personally i agree with limited extent to this idea , however i still believe there is a room for small business in some areas around the world .In the following essay i will enlighten some outlines and explain the reasons behind my opinion.
Some people think that availability of big supermarkets in USA and Canada for example , with all varieties they have in different sectors will attract costumers from all ages to satsisfy their needs , and that idea is correct if we consider the time we spend in one small shop to buy few items then we have to drive for further location to buy another purchase we need which wasnt available in first shop .
Nevertheless , small cities and some countries with less development still have less from these enormous supermarkets people in these areas still depend in other way to buy their needs from small local shops .For instance in middle east countries with big population like jordan or iraq , there's million of people who suffer from long distance tranport to find big shops to fillful all their needs . Whilst
they can figure out few small shops around them to find what they want .
To summarize , some small business will continue to show necessary

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Material achievement has been discussed at a high frequency in some countries; people widely involve this topic in every aspect of their lives. This essay will give two possible reasons for this phenomenon and explain the negative impacts on society.
Two major causes keep people lingering on this topic. Firstly, the difficulties in earning a living in some countries have significantly drawn people's focus on finance. For instance, more job opportunities are needed for job seekers in countries with low productivity. Besides that, in many low-income countries, people have to endure low pay; in some extreme cases, their earnings can not cover their spending. Therefore, tremendous anxiety cause people from these countries constantly talk about their financial situations.
On the other side, flaunting is becoming the mainstream mindset in some countries. Commonly, in some countries that just escaped poverty, the increasing spared money makes showing off possible. People in these countries display their wealth by owning luxurious items, such as branded bags or jewelry. Therefore, money naturally becomes essential in their conversations.
Although the reasons for money focusing vary, it might develop into risky societal factors. If the frequent discussion of finance is due to insufficient employment or inadequate wages, it is an alarm to the governments to carry on measures of boosting industries' development. Otherwise, riots might be expected and harm social safety. Furthermore, this widespread discussion highly leads to material comparison, which harms morality and even allows crimes to occur. When individuals obsess with showing off, they feel the shame of disposing of the downsides. To maintain a perfect image- especially a wealthy appearance, some people even turn to crime, such as stealing or robbery.
To conclude, folks popularly discuss money for various reasons, such as the demands of work or psychological factors. However, the phenomenon is not a positive sign to society and most likely indicates the upcoming crisis.",8.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,"Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, populations are growing all over the world, and increasing the source of food is becoming more important and also being challenging nowadays. One of the most important matters nowadays is eating insects and unhealthy sources of natural food. Some people in some areas are getting benefits from eating insects as a meal where insects are the worst scenario in nature.
however, there is some cultivating support that comes from insects which is a positive impact on the land or cultivating areas. Such as, it helps plants to grow fast and healthier. Many people use insects in their cultivating land as organic manure. it reduces dying trees and plants and provides enough energy and nutrition to plants to grow faster, healthier, and keep fresh. All over the world, people in so many areas are most familiar with those insects. By using insects on their land, they are doing it with less cost and more efficiency and also they are not providing too much effort to get insects as it comes from nature so easily.

2,"Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today's tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people's lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.",9.0,6.5,"Scores: 7, 6"
2,It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one's own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one's vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn't always easy because the viewer's attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",8.0,8.0,"Scores: 8, 8"
2,"Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Boxing is a dangerous kind of sport that may cause physical injury. Some people tend to believe that this sport should not exist nowadays. This controversial statement has both advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed in this essay.
A tremendous number of people think that boxing is an excellent way to fit a body and improve coordination. For instance, if parents want their kids to know how to defend themselves, they let them attend boxing masterclasses. However, the main aim for parents is to find a skilled, experienced coach for their children. They may think if a teacher is an expert, their kids will not suffer during training. Notwithstanding, it does not always work like that.
On the other hand, a lot of people completely disagree that boxing as a business industry has a right to exist in the modern world. They are convinced that people who fight should not suffer because of the wishes of rich people who enjoy the show. For example, if a young person gets a physical injury during a fight, he will probably get money for that; however, it does not mean that he will get better after the final battle. Also, people who protest against this blood sport probably dislike advertisements related to boxing. They may think that even these videos impact people's behaviour and motivate them to commit violence against others.
In conclusion, boxing is a part of the blood business that should be forbidden in the modern age. From my point of view, if a person wants boxing nowadays, there are a lot of different ways to do it, like VR simulation, without harming other people.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"There are many factors to encourage the quality of societies, some people believe that competitiveness is the main factor to improve communities. The following essay will focus on importance of competitiveness on individuals and cite my opinion which believe that it is a positive trend to develop societies.
First of all, if you want to improve a skill of an individual in the differnet aspects of life like sport, you should play him with higher level to develop his talent and get best of him. For example ,a famous tennis table player from my town said in an interview, that he improved his talent when he played against his older brother, he was working hard in training sessions to reach the higher level, the standard that his brother plays in order to beat him and win games. The competetion between him and his brother lift up his skills and strenthgen his mentality.
secondly, competitions may create good atmosphere and healthy climate for children to improve thier abilitie in study. For example, my daughter and her friends in the class were struggling in studying math, the math teacher found a way to make the math more interesting for students, the teacher announced for a competition every day at the end of lesson, she writes an equations on the board and gives prizes for students who can solve them. Nowadays, my daughter is enjoying to solve math problems. Furthermore, competitions can improve people's career, and increase company's outcome, some managers tend to encourage competitiveness between employers to have more benefits for company and workers as well.
To conclude, competitiveness enables people to improve their talents and students to love what they study, also employers will develop their skills, as a result of that most societies will get more benefits of this trend.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country's financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country's financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.",9.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.
First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.
For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.
As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.",5.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,"The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The Internet is employed extensively across the world, serving as an essential tool of communication. Nevertheless, the widespread use of internet triggers an intense debate. Some people hold that the use of internet should fall under control, while others disagree and argue that such control is groundless. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.
As for those who support the control of the internet use, they may have their position grounded upon the fact that criminal activities run rampant online, threatening individual and public security, as exemplified by hacking technology aimed at stealing personal data illegally, fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and notices post by terrorist groups brainwashing the public. Such activities, if unchecked, may exert undesirable effects on individuals and society. Given such omnipresent dangers online, the control of online activities may be justified.
On the contrary, in terms of those objecting to the control of the internet use, they may justify their position by highlighting importance of unlimited online activities, as demonstrated by the improvement of work efficiency. A case in point is that posting advertisements online is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street, from the perspective of a company intending to publicising its services and products. However, the notices post online may present fake information cheating the public. To address this issue, it is necessary to control online activities.
As far as I am concerned, in view of omnipresent hazards online, intervention is needed to screen dangerous information and ensure the safety of the internet use.
To conclude, the control of online activities helps to protect us from various cybercrimes, although it may slightly affect the efficiency of work. Personally, I opine that the importance of online control should not be underestimated.",8.5,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"
2,Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?,"In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,Write about the following topic:Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is a debatable issue regarding competition and cooperation. Some people hold that adolescents should be encouraged to compete, while others disagree and argue that teaching children to work together is more important. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.
As for those highlighting the importance of competition, these people may have their position grounded upon the fact that children can learn a lot by competing against each other, especially when they encounter numerous obstacles brought by their strong opponents and suffer failures. Only under such adverse conditions can children understand their drawbacks and the ways of improvement. Apart from that, if children have hard-earned victories over competent rivals, they are likely to gain tremendous pleasure of success as well as huge confidence that motivates them to keep working diligently and achieve more success.
On the contrary, in terms of those attaching greater importance to cooperation than to competition, these people may justify their position by citing a large number of examples elucidating the role of collaboration in various tasks, such as the production of a high-tech gadget of which the parts are manufactured by different countries, and a formal meeting where people present their respective views on a given issue in order to comprehenively understand the situation. Admittedly, these examples sufficiently explain the importance of cooperation. However, this does not mean that cooperation must outweigh competition since the two ways of interaction influence us differently and it is rather impractical to identify which one is more influential to us.
To sum up, competition and cooperation benefit us in different ways. It is hardly possible to conclude which one is more important to us.",8.5,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month's notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family's capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family's quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property's value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.",9.0,8.0,"Scores: 8, 8"
2,Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Written language has been in human history since many thousand years ago. It was first developed through ancient egyptians and other old civilizations to keep history safe and remembered. It was then reformed for learning, teaching, documenting know-how and building new civilizations. From the Latin to the modern English, an enormous amount of changes and developments have emerged. Such things were derived through the intent of humanbeings to use easier language to deliver its usages. I am of the opinion, that changing language and using it in a more relaxed way could destroy its basis and strong meanings, which it shall deliver in its original form.
Using a less formal language for writing could be associated with multiple different advantages. More people will be able to write using a language easier and faster, if it is in a more relaxed way compared to the formal version of it. So using such easy version of the language, could promotes the amount of written work, which accordingly supports the idea of keeping our culture remembered. For instance, the amount of written stories in English has doubled through the years after making the english a more easier language to apply and write with. Furthermore, such more relaxed language will help many non-fluent speakers learn and use the language faster, which shall increase the amount of people speaking this specific language.
On the other hand, a couple of critical disadvantages could be distinguished applying such strategy in the written language. Maybe the amount of written ressources increased massively in the last couple of hunderd years, but what about the quality and sophistication of such materials? Are these materials concrete, concise and accurate? Are those materials capturing the needed knowledge within the current generation successfully? These questions trigger that easier language to use doesn't neccessarily mean better documents, but rather massive irrelevant amount of expolited work.
To summarive, I tend to be of the opinion, that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of using a less formal language in writing. The long-term perspective could be significantly critisized, as only short-sighted point of views, shall think, that such methodology of written language helps human civilizations thrive in any way.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Personally, I strongly consent the view due to the fact that none of them is superior to other. This essay will explore the foremost motives reflecting this and provide evidence to prove the arguments.
There are manifold reasons for home activities division. First and foremost, equality of gender. In modern socities either Ladies nor Men is better than other. For this reason, once both are integral workers, they should divide domestic activities. Moreover, the one who come first at home should task without any prejudice. Let's take the couple Ronaldo, although they are famous one as well as wealthy personalities, they help each other in meals cooking. Hence, the couple is happy and stable.
Other reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering. In the contemporary times, mandams should be treated equally as Sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism. For instance, in a number of African regions girls still regarded as inferior by their husbands. As a result, human rights are constantly violated which undoubtedly undermine their live's style and personality.
In conclusion, couple of genders should obviously share the household occupations because both have the same rights as well as occupations.

2,Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays most people tend to write in a more informal way, adopting a relaxed approach. This essay will cover the reasons why this behavior is so common, starting from the necessity of a more quick way to communicate, and then it will attempt to illustrate if it has advantages and disadvantages.
Hence the necessity to interact in a quicker way, due to the business of life at the present time, many people prefer to cure less the formal aspects of their written pieces. This rapidness has been allowed by the spread of emails as the principal mean of written communication. Likewise, the reader itself, having much less time, is prone to take just a rapid look at the emails, not caring much if the way they are written is formal or not.
On the one hand, this can lead to some advantages, such as a more relaxed atmosphere even in workplaces. For example, many workers are relieved to know that their boss is keen on writing informal emails and does not pretend his subordinates to do otherwise. Moreover, it has some positive implications also for strangers, that are often less prepared to write in a formal style.
On the other hand, it is often hard to draw a limit. Some readers can think that the person sending the informal email is just being rude, leading to a misunderstanding. This is particularly true when the generation gap is taken into consideration: generally, elder people may be less willing to receive an informal letter.
In conclusion, the reasons behind a more relaxed style in written language may be found in the faster means of communication. This has undoubtedly advantages, such as the creation of a more peaceful ambient.

More specifically, by doing so, schools can provide specific objectives to meet students' needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences, personalities, and interests. Therefore, through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence, schools cannot only tailor a result-oriented syllabus to explore each student's maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind. In contrast, ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension. Furthermore, this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts, considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments.
Others, however, who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration, also make valid arguments. Despite the possible imbalance in each student's academic performance in a class, superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others. Their strengths, such as learning attitudes and methods, can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study. In addition, the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for children's all-rounded development. Since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical, this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts, and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight-A students in separated classrooms.
In conclusion, although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngsters' gifts in the streaming, it is still too early and unfair at this stage. Therefore, I believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class, and undoubtedly, we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,"Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?","In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child's learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child's and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child's misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child's paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children's learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay.

Anyway, a lot of people think that this types of sports are very dangerous and should be banned. This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.
Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.
Anyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous. Especially with skiing, a person should never go alone in places that don't have the right equipment to guarantee a safe experience; many times when practicing this types of sports, athletes from all over the world decide to go over their limit going to practice in zones that are known to be dangerous or unsafe and, in this cases, the possibility of something bad to happen is high.
Personally, I think that when you want to practice or experiment a sport that is extreme you should take all the right prevention to make the experience as safe as possible to avoid any injuries. Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end.",7.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree),"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide.

2,Write about the following topic.It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As society becomes more and more saturated with technology, traditional cultures are losing their roles in society. The compatibility of technology and traditions are often debated where some suggest it is possible, whereas, others argue it is not. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and conclude by saying how and why it is almost impossible.
Since people usually appreciate limited ways of living, it is challenging for both conventions and technology to co-exist. They will usually choose one method or another but not both at the same time. For instance, a company would have to focus on using human labour or advanced machineries to produce a product. The incompatibility may not be obvious at first but as technology develops futher, use of machines will increase but employment will decrease. Furthermore, technology is often considered to be more convenient and faster by many people. Work can be done more efficiently so workers will start to abandon the old ways of living or working.
In contrast, it might be possible for two values to work along in society due to different tastes of various people. Traditional cultures are usually appreciated by old generation such as grandparents, meanwhile, new generation prefers technology in their life. For example, grandparents can read newspaper while grandchildren watch TV or play games during family time. Moreover, although it is hard for a company to use both at the same time, it is not totally impossible. If the number of machines is controlled during production, human labour and machines can work together to maximise productivity by covering up each other's disadvantages.
All in all, even though traditional values and technology can be compatible theoratically, it is indeed difficult to compromise the use between two in real life. Ergo, people would have to beware of the risk of losing traditional cultures, if at all.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,Write about the following topic:Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.
On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.
There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.
In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is often argued, that when employers pay a bonus to the people who work for them as a recognition for their commitment to the company this action can be an incentive for the people involved, while for others have an opposite effect. This essay will examine advantages and disadvantages for this type of management and consider different methods to encourage people to work hard.
First of all, I strongly believe that when business practise recognised employers work with a financial reward the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this action. Despite the fact that only a partial amount of employees receive it, this has a positive impact among people that get the bonus, because their hard work is recognised, but also stimulates other to commit more for the company in order to achieve the same recognition. As a result, this management system is beneficial among all the employers. However, I think that this is not the only way to encourage people to work hard. In addition to the economic support, companies can improve the employees performance allowing flexible time or with additional time off. For instance, in my office when we work in for a deadline to issue a project, the directors always allow people that have been involved in the project to get free time. Despite, we work really hard the idea of getting holiday bonus encourage people to work as much as they can and they are aware that all this effort will be recognised.

2,Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree),"Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It's weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,"Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Translation softwares are a convenience that we see popping up more and more around us these days. I have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. For example, I was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the US. While there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. On paying closer attention I realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. It took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!
This is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. Witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. In the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.
Coming from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that I would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. This is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. When I was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured I also learned another one of our National languages that was prevalent in the region. By the time I was six-seven years old, I could conveniently speak in two languages. Meanwhile, in school, I was being exposed to the English alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand English too. I can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.
Later on, during my college days, I met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. The movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result I have a passing knowledge of six languages today. This knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.
In conclusion, I believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. Truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. It has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. From my personal experiences, I believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. Translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill.",7.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people believe that having a population with a mixture of nationalities makes countries more interesting and helps them to develop faster. In my opinion, people from different nationalities have their own points of view, therefore each of them provide different perspectives to make a country more developed.
People who lives in a country with one nationality generally do not want other people from different countries to migrate their countries. The reason for this kind of thought is about safety of their countries. Moreover, they do not want to employ people who migrated. Therefore, these countries become more and more isolated from other ones. In this globalization area, a country which has just a one way of thinking, do not have oppurtinity to develop and becoma a interest to different nationalities.
On the other hand countries with multinational populations have mixture of cultures. Each of the people provides a different tradition of their own nationality. These traditions may become a way of entertainment to attract tourists. Due to the tourism being a source of income, it is one of the development sources of a country.
In addition, nowadays, there are lots of countries who lets knowledagble employees from other nationalities to work in their countries. These high skilled workers can be positioned in the places in need. Their ideas can be valued. If a country support them, they can be the new face of the development.

2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.

Therefore, governments and large companies need to improve the environment and it must be a large impact for society. I strongly disagree this opinion, because individuals also make a difference for the environment to some extent.
Initially, there is no doubt that governments, large companies and organizations have a large initiative to change the environment. For example, in Europe, especially in Germany, they are planning to make some restrictions on car industries not to manufacture cars which consume only petrol as energy in near future. Therefore, even in some sports car companies started releasing a new type of car which take advantage of electricity, which is a sustainable resource. Therefore, governments and companies control peoples' lifestyle.
On the other hand, people have already become aware of dangerous environment they are on the line. Therefore, many people voluntarily started to pick up garbage on the street and seaside. They also purchase sustainable bottles, instead of tapping into plastic bottles. In addition, technology has advanced in a few decades, and some influencers on the internet warn about issues of the environment. This means that individuals regardless of generation start to make some communities on social media and hold some events. For example, they discuss what they can do in their daily routine to reduce the consumerism, and which materials are realistically sustainable stuff in our lifestyle. As a result, some people start to establish a company geared towards eco-friendly company. For example, some companies launched the project to manufacture the solar panel and make strategies on how to spread them around the world as a sustainable and renewable resource.
Finally, of course, large companies and governments have a large power to control
the environment more beautifully. On the other hand, these organizations also configured by individuals. Therefore, governments need to add an environment subject in the curriculum at school. Consequently, more people start to consider on how to improve the environment in a large organization, the more people will suggest and make specific plans individually. If the ideas were rejected, they can post these ideas on the internet and people will come together to make a specific project.

For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.",7.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"

One the one hand, it is a fact that young children who work looking after animals and plants learn how to respect the environment and develop an elevated sense of responsability. Certainly, activities such as taking care of animals and grow vegetables favour children in many aspects of their lives, like to have a better health, mostly because of doing lots of outdoor activities and eating healthier food than city children.
On the other hand, if children learn how to work as a farmer, they could try to do it alone, without any supervision, which is surely a hard work, with a lot of difficult and responsabilties. In order words, those tasks could be dangerous to a child and affect negatively its live. For example, it is necessary to use some special tools to deal with vegetables, and those tools could harm easily a child. In addition, looking after animals and plants take too much time and children must spend their time studying and having fun instead of working.
In conclusion, although the benefits that people can find in teaching young children to deal with animals and grow vegetables, the disadvantanges of children doing those tasks are extremely high, because of some permanent damages which could be caused by dangerous tools.

Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages.

First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.

Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.
Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.
To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress.

There are two main reasons why a young person decides to use drugs, namely, a dysfunctional family and depression. A dysfunctional family is known to be a family with a lack of communication, and this family isn't worried about their son. For example, both parents are alcoholics, and they don't care about their son. The child starts using drugs only because someone else does it. On the other hand, a young people suffering depression can easily become addicted. For example, a teenager is bullied at the school. He doesn't want to go anymore and feels lonely. In order to change this situation, he finds a refuge in drugs because he feels confident and loved.
The effects of drug use by young people are multiples. Generally, they can't be focused. They prefer to stay in an unreal world rather than the real world. For example, a student who dreams of become engineer will have issues to finish their studies.

2,Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Many people claim that home based education is most appropriate for the childrens and their progress, while others believe that studying at school is more import. While teaching children at home might be useful for getting better score and children be more included, I personally am of the opinion that school based education is far outweigh in areas like socializing and it's more important for the future life.
It is often said that when childrens studying at home is better for their development. When student has no distractions such as classmates and school drama and sometimes bullying they are more involved and motivated to study and get good assignments. Moreover, they have less stress comparing themselves to others. For example, during the pandemic of Covid-19 students all over the world were transeffered for home education and this process brought big educational success to all of them. Overall, home base education has one very big benefit among all others, it is the posibility for student to be more focused on education without any distractions.
However, education at school has their pros too and most important of them is socializing. For every person is very important to know how to work, deal and socialize with other people and it's very good when someone can learn it in the school rather than in adult life. For instance, University of Latvia in their research in 2008 proved that students who studied at school are more socialized and are bigger part of the community in their adult life than students came from home based education. In conclusion, school based education is good for styding not only school programm, but also real life.
From my perspective, socializing skills outweight the educational success as it's more important for an adults life.
To conclude, both methods of education either home based or school based have their benefits. Every person should decide for themselves what is better for them or their childrens.",7.0,5.5,"Scores: 5, 6"
2,Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"During the dinner, most of families like to watch news on television or read newspapers. Sometimes these news could be violents and it could be an issues for our childs. Some people argues that they should be restricted. In my point of view, it is important to protect child from these horrific images, but also we need to keep informed them about the world if we want to protect them.
First of all, children and young people need to be protect from these violent informations. One mean to accomplish that, is to explain to them these kind of violent images. Because, they are in fairly part of their development and that could be have a huge impact on their mental health. For instance, if your children saw an image of attentat in a high school, as a result, it could be difficult for him to go back at school further. Morover, he could likely developed mental health problem, as a phobia or anxiety about high school.
On the other hand, it is important to keep inform them about the real world and they need to be prepare for theses situations. For example, if an attack arrived at their school, your children will be prepared for. Conversely, if they did not watched news, and an attack reached the school, they will not be able to protect them and the consequence could be terrible. As far, news allow us to predict the world and be able to protect us and our family.
As far, we have seen it is important to keep contact with reality, because nowadays, our world are violent and as a result, some image could be violent. They need also to be protect from mental health problems, and so we need to explain that they watch and these images.",5.5,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,"Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?","Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people's desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer's health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue).

Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.
The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.
In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.
In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,

2,"Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.",8.0,8.0,"Scores: 8, 8"
2,Dieting can change a person's life for better or worse (from Target Band,"This essay was written on a topic from ""Target Band 7"" book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskDieting can change a person's life for the better or ruin one's health completely. What is your opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsSome argue that dieting has an extraordinary impact on one's life, whereas others are of a view that it absolutely adversely affects a person's health. It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one's body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one's level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one's body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one's life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.The writer's opinion is very clear from the start and throughout the entire essay.

2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","With new technologies come new ways to communicate with people. First, we had emails and now we have social media and a variety of different apps that give us the opportunity to chat with one another. And this kind of online communication entered not only our personal but also our professional life. This topic is rather controversial and people have different opinions about that, so in this essay, I'm gonna be talking about pros and cons of the new type of working communication.
First, I would like to start with some advantages of online communication at work. In my opinion, the main thing that makes people go from meeting face to face to talk online is the fact that it's more convenient. We don't have to set a specific date to meet someone. And also we can talk to someone from wherever we want, without needing to drive to the office. The two things we need are our cellphone or computer and the internet connection. But I think nowadays it won't be a problem for anyone because the majority of people have each of this stuff.
The second advantage - the functionality of apps for online communication. Let's take Zoom. I think almost everyone used this app in 2020 during lockdowns all over the world, including myself. You can arrange a meeting with thousands of people, using this app. This is much easier than gathering large amounts of people in one place. You can also record this meeting if you wish and send this recording to people who were absent or use it yourself in the future to remember all the details. Face to face meetings do not provide us with all these opportunities.
If we talk about disadvantages, I do not see a lot of them. The only thing that we can miss in online communication is the ability to see human emotions and facial expressions. I find it really important, especially when it comes to discussing important projects or deals. From my own experience, I can say that when there was a lockdown in my country due to the pandemic, I missed physical interaction with my colleagues, such as handshaking, etc. I find physical interaction to be an effective way for team building, so it's might be hard to work without it, using only online communication.
To conclude, I would say that everyone can have different opinions about whether it's better to meet online or face to face. But what I am sure about is that we should not get rid of face to face meetings completely. Otherwise, It will be hard to keep the team tigh-knit.",7.5,6.5,"Scores: 7, 6"

While it is admittedly true that when used inappropriately, technology may expose us to a host of dangers and thus complicate our lives, it is, however, necessary for us not to overlook the benefits of technology to society. Given that technology changes many factors of our lives, I strongly believe that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages.
In terms of mobile phones bringing people closer together, these technological devices enable people to stay in touch no matter where they are. In the past, when people have to use telephones to contact with each other, is now replaced with social media, which is a convenient alternative for communication. For instance, smartphone applications such as email or WhatsApp, an instant messaging service, help people in different parts of the world interact with one another. Therefore, wireless communication networks facilitate communication and make people's lives easier and more convenient.
Regarding time efficiency, computers are an expendient way for people to find information instantly. Comparing to the past when people spends hours a day in a library to look for information using books, we can surf the Internet now. As an example. Wikipedia is an online, open-source encyclopedia that lets people browse for factual knowledge, and SCMP.com is a website which lets people catch up on the latest news. Conversely, if people carelessly use the Internet, they will result in discovering false messages, which readily mistaken their perspectives.
Having discussed that information technology certainly modifies our daily lives, as well as the drawback of it, if people can use technology properly, I am confident that technology will better streamline people's daily schedules.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?,". There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors' decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can't deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important.

Some argue that routine behavior is adequate for spending their life, by others do not agree with this thought. This essay will attempt to provide a brief analysis.
First of all, it is a fact that people feel comfortable to being and doing things that they being familiar with, by fixing routine in every day we can make our life certain and manageable. For example, working in the same company for many years not only make a sustainable income but also become more expert in this working field. This helps people to reduce the risk of facing things we not prefer.
However, all of the creatures has to develop and adapt to an environment to survive in this crucial world and not even human, this important for us to leave our comfort zone in some situation.

2,"Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?","Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children's development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children's all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students' differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students' different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students' versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay.

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to unprivileged countries rather than financial aid.
I agree, for the most part, as we have seen from history, sadly the leaders of those countries aren't always thinking of helping their citizens with the money they got gifted. These world leaders could think of themselves first and satisfy themselves before they do anything else. Sometimes the world leaders don't help, after helping themselves they build their armies, and buy more weapons for more destruction. Before countries decide to help other countries with financial aid, they should analyze the world leader and see what type of world leader they could be. If the world leader shows any signs of selfishness, money won't help their citizens, it doesn't help with their situation at all. When the citizens find out their world leader isn't helping them with the financial aid, they could go violent and cause riots, revolutions, and a huge decrease in currency strength, which will increase poverty, homelessness, and famine.
On the other hand sending resources such as beverages, clothes, and books to help increase the number of educated people in the country would be far more useful. unfortunately, these types of countries have a problem with education among the citizens, many citizens want to educate themselves but aren't able to.

It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them.

The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today's society's obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today's society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this.

2,Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?,"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call ""social anxiety disorder"". There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay.

Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.
Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.
Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.
While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.
To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies.

2,"Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation's art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation's own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries' collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.",8.0,7.5,"Scores: 7, 8"
2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"Nowadays, due to a wide range of education methods and systems, there are a lot of opinion and debates for which being the best orientation for students. Some experts believe that it is good for pupil to only focus on a few subjects during their school life. However, some criticisms argue that the more subject students have, the more practical knowledge they can require. For me, both of such education systems might have different benefits for students as well as I prefer the latter rather than the former.
First of all, there may have some evidence for people to reckon the upsides of concentration on mainly subjects, Considering the fact that learning too many subjects can be very time-consuming and they may feel confused as well as overwhelmed when they gain a lot of knowledge at the same time. Given a circumstance, students who are studying in Hong Kong must take the DSE every year from the age of fifteen, the Hong Kong examination and Assessment Authority recommends students do not choose more than seven subjects during the exam. Result from having more practices as well as revisions as much as they can. Hence, if students would like to do a test, they could be more suitable to study the primary subjects.
Conversely, some criticisms considered that it is probably good for students to pick up variety of subjects in view of finding their interests and avoiding spoon feed information. Since many educators think that Hong Kong education system is too exam-oriented, this way could harm students mental and physical health. For instance, parents who are from Hong Kong complain about the education curriculums are too concentrated on spoon feed information rather than giving more life experience to students once in a while. That is why parents sometimes enjoy to choose various of study tours as well as extra curriculums for their children. Thus, some people tend to having more immersing the experience more than studying a few of subjects in their young age.
In summarize, it is hard to say which opinion would be the best since different types of education methods may have their advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, personally, it is the key that pupils will never know what they can done until they tried. That is the reason why I prefer studying vary subjects in their young age than being an expert in the major part.",5.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,"The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.
Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.
Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.
Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.",7.0,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"

I fully disagree that people think it is better to develop technology to live with rather than try to decrease and solve the climate change.
In my opinion, if human could think about a way to live with climate change, it means that they have already thought, they failed to repared damages of global warming. Everyone should reduce their greenhouse gases thanks to their actions as wasting less, taking more public transports or stopping overconsumption. Even if local scale is a significant part to decline climate change, there are also governments and corporations which should decrease their polluting actions. Moreover, it is not as it could not work because during Covid's period when each country minimized its actions, the climate change slumped back and it is essential even crucial.
Futhermore, if people suggest to find a way to live with it, it illustrates that the entire Earth's planet could be collasped or may be destroyed. It depicts a negative perception of our forthcoming living's environment.

On the one hand,many people agree with this statement for many reasons.The most significant is that you learn so much in a group since there are people with experience who you will benifit from not just that but the interaction with differenet people gives you a new perspective on life. for example when you engage in conversation with people who have different backgrounds and believes your mind becomes more clearer and optimistic.in addittions if your a shy or an intervort person you will learn how to over come your obstecles.for instance, you will make alot of friends since your around people that often.

This phaenomenon have caused the development and expansion of supermaket but also the closure of local businesses. I agree with the part of people who think that local business play a vital role in the life of local commuities that will be almost death in the next few years.
In Italy 50 years ago to buy food people had to go to street market. They used to buy km 0 products respecting the season of production of fruit of vegetables. People have to talk to each other, people have to go shopping respecting the workhours of people who had to produce the products and then sold them. In the last year, supermaket have caught on. Their goal is to offer how many products possible, without taking care of the season in which a certain product should be found in the market. For instace, if you want to buy cherries in winter now you can to to the nearest supermarket and find them, even if is November. By contrast, before supermarket's developement people had to wait the productive season of cherries and waint until summer to eat them. This phaenomenon had take people to prefer supermarket because they can find more products. However the consequences of this choice are in my opinion dramatic.
First of all, the clousure of local business is causing a breakdown on the economical status of different countries. For instance, in Sicily there are still different people who work the ground and survive because they produce and sell their own products. It used to be their job. However, because of the supermakert their job is not apprecciated and they are losing money and the possibility to continue their job. This dramatic phaenomenon is surely causing the death of local communities because a vital part of the community itself is losing job. Another example coming from my personal experience might be the following. Nowadays you can buy a product to clean and polish your shoes in a supermaket. 50 years ago my grandfather used to go to the city center where a man used to clean and polish the shoes for him. It was his job. I had the extraordinary opportunity to meet this old man who clean and polish my shoes for little money. He was happy because, even if he is conscious that is almost impossibile, he hope to have the opportunity to do this job as long as possible. He told me that to clean shoes on the street for fifty years have given him the opportunity to meet people and to talk with them. After I have known him, I thought that because of globalisation we are losing our roots as well as the possibility of knowing our own place and people.

Perhaps some people believe that there are more transparent in distinct research and information. However, some critics concern about some imformation not being shared freely as well. This eassy will discuss both these viewpoints in the following paragraphs.
First of all, people tend to the more information the internet has, the more benefit the users get. This means that people will become more proficient in their majors and works due to gaining a lot of relevant resources online in different areas. A case in point is different professional like managers, doctors, teachers and lawers can require a wider range of references to complete and reach their working goals as well as improve the workplace situation. Hence, it is highly likely to see that it may good to share as much information as possible online.
Conversely, some critis argue that if every information shared freely, it would harmful to academic development such as intellectual property. This is to say that when people missused these kinds of information, there would occur plagiarism much more easily. A good illustration to my point is some university students would copy different resources to their eassies in order to get a higher sorce or avoid some complicated experiments. Even some companies will copy another products design from their opponents. Therefore, it is possibly to say that in bid to protect their intellectual property, some information must not have shared by free.

The way I see this matter is there is a couple of major causes which includes the following;
Firstly, socity reasons;
Well, usually in each country pepole will lead some ideology thoughts and movments on certain topics and trends where focusing on certin major or studies considered to be the best decision that you can take which will lead to a great opportuntites for you as an indvedual and we all know that today people sees the scince as thing that will give you a knwoledge not an amazing future.

Secondly, Religious reasons
You maybe surprised to read this however, it's actullay one of the issues that causes the lack of having enough students studying science.
The best way to explain this reason is by example where in Saudi Arabia between the 1990 until 2013 a Religious were preaching peploe about the danger of studing science and that they should only focus on religion subjects.
Having that happend now will causes a lot to the society, where people will be less educated about the basics of our world.

There are plenty of reasons for this problem and what effect does this have on society? This essay will suggest many reasons for this problem.
The main reason of this problem is lack of trained Math and Science teachers. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to persue science, They will develop Science and Math phobia. Due to which they will prefer to choose any other stream than science to pursue their higher education.
Eventually, this will effect society in many ways. If students stopped taking science as their majors, their will be shortage of doctors. Because of that, people will suffer from many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take science as their major there will be no placement of science teachers for the future generation. According to me, Government should take firm steps to stop this from happening. There must be some training or some programs to keep teachers up to date to enhance their teaching.This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I belive that government and teachers should take the responsibility to create the environment to learn these subjects in a fun way.

However, it is being frecuently controversial, because whereas some claim to control it, others request its entire freedom. In my opinion, Internet needs to be controlled and in some instances it needs to be restricted.
Internet is a useful modern technology that has changed the methods of communication and the information storage. However, it is vital to establish regulations in its use, because, even though, it is a great technological advance that improved the communication and information procedures. it is also a powerful mechanism that might impact negatively the human lives. For instance, internet can be use to obtain personal information that could be use in unlawful ways such as supplant identities to commit virtual crimes. Therefore, if internet is not use within legal frames, the probabilities of intranet crimes are likely to increase in the entire society.
On the other hand, some people claim for its freedom because they do not want to be surveillanced. Althouth some people claim for freedom of their privacy, it looks like they do not understand the importance of a set of rules within the internet to protect privacy. For instance, some couples like to share nude images and videos between themselves through social media apps. however, there is evidence that these kind of content have been stolen to blackmail the couples in return for not revealing their compromising information. Therefore, if people claim for freedom when navigating into the red, it is crucial to have legal parameteres that might help to protect their privacy.

Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.
There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.
Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.

Although doing things alone is beneficial as it strengthens decision making skills, working in teams can educate more valuable life lessons as it teaches teamworking and negotiation skills necessary for living in a community.
Firstly, working in a group helps build teamworking skills. In a team, in order to be successful in doing peojects, members need to help one another in achieving mutual goals. Therefore, through these steps, team members will be trained on assisting others to reach the goal, although they may feel more competent undergoing a project on their own. Similarly, in real societies, people living in the same community cannot be careless to their neighbors and, instead, have to understand each other. Because of this understanding, they can tolerate one another.
Still, it can be argued that working collectively nurtures people to follow the crowd and hence, they cannot sharpen decision making skills. For this point, it is valid that a lone wolf has a clearer vision in its life direction than a pack of wolves that walk behind a leader. Still, a single leader may lead to a wrong path that ends up to a disaster for all other wolves. Thus, in order to make a right decision effectively, it is required that people work together since they can debate and negotiate what is appropriate for the team which, in turn, beneficial for each individual. Likewise, in a country, no single prime minister can dictate the country's direction. Nevertheless, opinions gathered from the parliament are necessary.
In conclusion, team projects are more useful in culminating skills crucial to live in a society.

One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief.
Manufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on.
Customers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods.
Personally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product.

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is advised that toddlers should learn about growing vegetables and raising animals. Although there are downsides to this proposal, the overall advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages in this matter.
The main advantage of teaching the younger generation how to farm vegetables and keeping animals is that it can enhance their understanding of the environment. There is no doubt that school kids could learn about the environment on books, but the most effective way is to interact with the habitation of vegetables and animals as they can easily be related with. In addition, by learning about foods and animals, children could quickly develop their awareness of not wasting food. Only when children realize how difficult and complicated it is to nurture food, can they stop wasting food or throwing food they dislike. For instance, public schools in Melbourne developed a targeted curriculum to supporting primary children to learn about the growth of foods and the significance of preserving the environment and reduce food waste. Hence, the advantage is obvious since younger pupils must recognise the world they live in.
However, it is suggested that the physical risk of allowing primary offspring to learn about farming could not be overlooked. One of the root disadvantages of caring for animals is the safety issue as animals might have potentially harmful effects on young kids. To elaborate, there is a mixture of the hidden virus on animals' bodies, due to the fragility of children's immune systems, they are too vulnerable to defend against external viruses, not to even mention the physical attack from animals to children. According to the agricultural department, there are 300 cases of animals attacking children reported every year in China, which could be considered as a piece of strong evidence of the disadvantages.

First of all, the public social services will be improved.This is due tho the reason that the government is not limited to its economic resources.For example when the government want to construct new road of any distance kilometers,it will construct within a given period of time
Another reason is based on how people are willing to pay taxes. In any developed country, people are likely to pay taxes willingly.Forexample when a company generate its revenue for more than 100%, its capable to pay the taxes and pay its employee high salary and sweet bonus.This leads to satification of citizens.
Addition to that, is ability for the high and middle economy class citizens to provide support or donations to poor or low level economy class citizens.This is due to the fact that rich people are often likely to provide to bread to the poor one.
In conclution, its obvious the fact that addition economy in the developed country is not the only factor to make its people satisfiable.There are number of factor including political stability, good government leadership but few to mention.However in my opinion i believe additional economy in economically giant country dramatically contribute to satification of majority of citizens.",6.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"

Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention.

2,Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people's awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel's audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that communication technology advancement leads to social problems. I partially agree with this statement. Social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook do have a toxic influence on people's relationships. But from the other hand, communication technology enables people to communicate freely, whether a person is physically in China or in America.
The rapid blooming of social media communication tools has made people's lives easier. But, there is another side of a coin – now individuals are able to create internet pages anonymously. This function has blown up people's trust. Now everybody can create a fake page on the internet and catfish another person, without revealing her/his personality. It is definitely a negative effect on relationships between people in general.
Nevertheless, modern communication technology connected so many people. For example, relatives who are living in different countries can preserve their family connections by communicating through online services and applications. This function can help to support relationships of people who are far away from each other. Moreover, there is evidence that people have started to date each other more, because of dating applications' progress. For shy and introverted people this is an important improvement because they can start chatting online and then gradually switch to real-life communication.
To conclude, modern communication technology has both benefits and drawbacks. The most important drawback is a deterioration of social trust because of the anonymous activity. But the benefits of using communication technology outweigh all the drawbacks. Communication technology gives the possibility to communicate with relatives, who are living on another edge of the planet.",7.0,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"
2,Write about the following topic.Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.Discuss both views and give your opinionGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Art, with its different types and genres, has been and will be an inseparable part of our children's developmental stage. Whether someone sees its value or not, art will one way or another find its way in our children's lives and have an influence. I strongly believe that art is crucial for our children to have as a subject at school and in this article I will try to explain why I believe so and give examples.
One of the major reasons why art is so essential is the diversity of the genres of art. Art could be in the form of playing music instruments, drawing, acting or even doing martial arts.
This diversity gives children the ability to choose what suits them best and focus on getting better at them. Not only that,but this also forms a big part of their personality. It is scientifically proven that this increases the average IQ of a child and it protects from depression later in the children's lives.
On the other hand, some parents have a different point of view, they see art as a distraction, believing that only merely scientific subjects are the real deal. However, their view may seem to look logical, as their wish is that their children would grow up to be doctors, scientists or something similar. I believe this is a noble goal but why not a doctor who can play a guitar? Or a scientist who is also a good actor ? Would not that be a great hobby to have in their free time?
An example that I encountered was when I started to learn martial arts and played the guitar and how this greatly helped me overcome a really tough time in my life and fight off depression.
In conclusion, I believe art is a subject that every student needs and to choose which suit them best later helps their lives drastically.",7.5,6.5,"Scores: 7, 6"

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents' house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people's opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer's opinion has been clearly stated.

I certainly agree that the benefits of acquiring a new language still outweigh that of using translation apps because it is a systematic learning and it is able to improve your competitiveness rather than rely on translating tools.
To learn a language, we must start form vocabulary and grammar then goes to the process of making up a sentence. In the initial stage it would be difficult to master the pronounciation but once you overcome this part, you are actually acquire the skills of using a foreign language naturally. Moreover, through the learning process, you are trying to gain permanent memory of it which won't let you forget the spelling of a word so soon. For example, language laerners usually perform well in certain areas such as academic or business field via lots of practices and trainings and they attribute to their hardwork instead of translating tools.
Using translation software is not a bad thing and the fact is they are available in these days yet heavy reliance on it can not bring you as much benefits as learning languages step by step. I can not deny that these tools are convenient and easy to use, however it may restrict our level of learning outcome from it function- translating word by word, which is usually lead to the result of wrong meaning of a sentence. Many learners, on the other hand trying to translating every text while they are reading an article, it may be useful to conquer the hardships initially, but in the long run they may forget all the contents since they are not memorize the meanings of a word and just let it go after the reading. The result is that they are underperforming because lack of training and unable to interprete the definition of words.

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion. In this essay I will explain both views and why I think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences.
Those supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen. This is because, only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores. For example, it is known that China sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the Olympics and statistically, they usually win numbers of medals.
On the other hand, those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non-top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed. For instance, Diego Maradona, a Argentinian soccer player, never played in a professional field, on the contrary, he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village. This means that by providing facilities for all, gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too.
In my opinion, as a supporter of the second view, I believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports. For me, winning is as essential as participation. Besides, this way leads to find natural talents among the local population, which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances.

Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage.

Many people view it as a legal right for individulas to marry whatever person, regardless of gender, they consider as a suitable partner. Others, however, believe that gay marriage should be illegal, as it spreads the notion that being gay is normal.
Certainly, both paries make some sound arguments supporing their views, and it is not effortless to decide which side to pick. Nevertheless, governments should not be basid towards any party's views, and a decision from the government must be based on the values and principles of its nation.
People supporing gay marriage claim that governments and individuals should not have the right to decide for people who to marry, as it damages the well-being of those individulals. Moreover, they argue that gayness is not a new tread that has just given a birth, but a natural behavior that has been existed among some types of animals for centuries.
People opposing gay marriage, however, claim that such a behavior will destory society as gay partners cannot reproduce, and thus, the population number will start gradually decrease.

This essay illustrates the reason why they are built in this way and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each type of building.
It is often said that the taller buildings are ideal for houses in metropolitan cities.The main reasons are the cost of land and a very large population in big cities.As a solution for this problem,people in big cities prefer taller buildings where the homes are easily affordable for them.However,this leads to over crowding and lack of adequate ventilation.For instance,in Mumbai,the largest city in India,the cost of land and the population is so high that the majority of the constuction companies build taller buildings in order to solve this problem.
In contrast,some cities with a lower population and comparatively lower cost of land build shorter buildings on a wide land.This enables cities to prevent over crowding in communities and have a wider open area with greenery providing a lot of ventilation helping people to lead a better life style.For example,in Chandigarh,a union territory in India,the construction of houses are perfectly executed providing enough space between each house as the cost of land and the population is relatively low when compared to cities like Mumbai.

However, there are many different ways is which employers can implement to increase theit employees satisfaction in the work environment. In this essay, I will discuss why money incetives can be beneficial, and mention different alternatives.
Rewarding employees with money is one of the best ways to guarantee employees retantion and prevent employees tunrover. This is because most people work to provide better life for them and their families, and extra money can help them achieve that. As a result, companies can increase their employees satisfaction and encourage them turn off job offers. For example, yearly bounses are one of the main incentives to encourage people to work harder. However, companies who do not pay enough bounses can loss many special employees.
While money is considerd as one of the main reasons why employees are satisfied, it can add extra expenses on the companies, which can affect their future success. Managers can use different ways to encourage employees to work harder by saying thank you or giving them extra day off after a long project, which can have a positive effect on the work quality. For instance, in some private companies in Saudi Arabia, managers usually reward their staff by giving them day off when there is an important football match or when the weather is great.

Some people think that playing outside provide more benefits compared to playing computer games. As a child who experienced both, I agree that playing outside is more beneficial.
Outdoor activities give children the opportunity to show and enhance their physical, mental, and social abilities. If a child plays in the park, he tends to explore different parts of the field by running or walking, and this develops his physical health. Joining a camping could help a kid develop his problem-solving skills, making him use his basic knowledge about the activity. A kid can also meet different children on a playground, with the same wave-length as his, and this allows him develop to be sociable to others.
On the other hand, computer games also gives kids a chance to develop their mental capabilities to the point that some get addicted playing it. Another disadvantage is it does not enable children to enhance their physical development. Other computer games offer problem-solving activities, logics, and reasoning, making children to exercise their cognitive abilities. Some games overstimulate the brain, to the point that a player can get hooked and addicted to it to play long hours. In addition, most of the computer games are not physically interactive, and let the players sit during the entire game. This would not benefit children to develop their muscles.
Although computer games could benefit children mentally but it has different disadvantages that outweighs the advantage of it.

There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.
Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Nowadays, it is often said that mass media interest in reporting crimes and violence happening in our society may lead to negative effects. Therefore, there is a public debate over the opportunity of excluding this kind of news from mass media, such as newspapers or television. In this essay, I will summarize the grounds for my stance, which is completely in favour of this viewpoint.
The mair reason why I believe that crimes and violence news should be restricted is the emulation risk. In this view, television is often watched by kids left alone, who may not be able to fully undestand what they see. Therefore, if they continue to hear about violence and crimes, they may begin to consider them as a normal part of our society and start adopting these behaviours. For instance, a teenager may think that it is normal to fight with someone else in case of an argue outside pubs or clubs.
Another reason in favour of crimes and violence news restriction is the exaltation of criminals. This may be epitomised by serial killers: on one side they are sentenced for terrible crimes, but on the other hand are sometimes proposed to accept a huge amount of money in order to make interviews or write books about their stories. If media did not talk about these crimimals, none of them would earn money as a consequence of its guilts.
In conclusion, I believe that there are many valid reasons for claiming a reduction of violence and crimes news on social media. Emulation of wrong behaviours by young people and enrichment of criminals are two of the most common arguments. All thing considered, I strongly advocate the need of restricting mass media's time spent to talk about crimes and violence.

However, rapid evolution of technologies and the fast consumption of natural resources are also major concerns for many scientists in today's world. Some people believe that more money spent on space exploration is inevitable for fulfulling the demands of scientific discovery and the future development of human technologies; however, many others argue that this money should be invested in other more useful places where more human lives can be improved.
Space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over the recent years. Scientists have long been searching for possible ways to contact the unknown lives outside this planet and unwrap the secrets of the universe such as the black holes and the birth of the space. The more advanced human-technologies become, the further an austronaut can travel to. Scientists believe that space discoveries can help human beings to develop new technologies and find new resources outside our solar system. However, the evolutions of technologies and equipments always require huge investments.
In fact, space exploration can be both benefitial and time-consuming. If such a scientific project is carried and supervised by a rich nation, greater success can be seen. However, there are many other pre-existing problems on the other side of this planet that require attention and aids, such as hunger and proverty. In this case, I think these issues should be prioritized because every human life is precious. If those people's lives are taken care off, there should be less worries on scientific research as well.

People try to cope with everything and do their best all the time but we do not have superpowers or an ability not to sleep 24 hours. Honestly, I firmly believe that it is closely linked to not having a hobby these days.
Needless to say, time spent on the leisure activities plunged compare to the last century. I firmly believe that one of the main reasons is an addiction to the usage of various technologies. The majority of teenagers cannot live a day without their phone. They try to hide from troubles in that unreal world of communication. I understand that a hobby can also be online, for instance, videogaming but, as I know, really few people perceive it that way. Honestly, the problem is not only in the modern decade, adults also often do not have a specific hobby. The reason of that can be only their overworking and willingness to achieve more than they have at the moment. This race to the best never ends and, sadly, affects others too. Children adopt the habits of their parents. It is a green light for young people to behave in the same way, to think only about work and do not spend any time outside.
On the other side, obesity, bad mental health and demotivation can be an effect caused by not having a passion for any activity. I have a great example of the topic - it is me. I had played football professionally for 5 years until I decided to quit the training because of a sense of disinterest in what I do with my life. After, although I started to feel worse and worse, I could not do anything else. I spend all day at the computer doing homework now. I firmly think that I am not the only person who cannot handle with feelings such as anxiety or sadness. Maybe it could be better if I had a stronger character but I guess that a large proportion of my peers think that they would never get enough of joy, therefore it is not only my problem.
To sum up, it is clearly understandable that internet and ""tendency to be depressed"" of present generation are rapidly displacing hobbies from human life. We need to think more about that problem because, in my opinion, we are really close to be as emotional and alive as robots.",7.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,"Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?","Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people's educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one's life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one's maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today's society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend.

It is argued that the government should be held solely responsable for this pandemic, but I personally disagree with this statement.
The government is already taking measures to prevent this devastating issue. Firstly, it is promoting numerous campaigns against obersity at a young age showing the detrimental effects that this condition can trig in a life time with the terrific consequences. Moreover, authorities are trying to correct unhealthy habits, taxing sugar in drinks and foods and removing sweet and high fat products from public areas, such as schools and hospitals. Therefore, Government can be consider highly active on confining the increased percentage of overweight children.
Not only ministries are exstensively advertising health pattern to control weight and discourage consumption of toxic products, but they are also involving the communities in outdoor events, such as presenting the new city soccer team. So that, while promoting sports and active lifestyle, youngster can be influenced by these athletes to pursue a better physical conditions. Nevertheless, government is promptly enhancing the importance of personal training class in primary school offering schoolars the possibility of choosing gym as extra class to add to their curriculum.
To conclude, although obesity rates are rapidly raising, I do not agree that government is responsible of this outcome. Clearly, it is broadly active engaging children in outdoor activities, yet limiting products from public areas. Hence, authorities are commiting to prevent this plague that could have horrible consequences on future adults.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many people smoke although they know how harmful smoking is. This essay believes that smokers continue to smoke because they are addicted to nicotine they smoke from cigarettes, and government should launch a campaign saying that smoking can make smokers become nasty or unpleasant to help reduce smoking in society.
Many smokers cannot stop smoking because they are addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes they have smoked. Nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed and calm when they smoke and makes them addicted to smoke when they feel they need to relax themselves. For example, many people smoke when they feel stressed and when they smoke they feel more relaxed and get some new work ideas according to many smoking survey reports.
It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking, so it should be government responsibility to help them and make smoking situation in the country better. Government should launch a campaign that makes smoking habit be nasty and unpleasant for non-smokers in the country. If smoking habit is not acceptable in the society, smokers will not want to do so at least in public because they want to be accepted by their friends or people in the society. For example, in Thailand, government launches a smoking campaign saying that smokers smell bad and it makes smokers uncomfortable to smoke because they do not want to be smelly people and unfriended by people.
In conclusion, people continue to smoke because of nicotine addiction, and it is important for government to take serious action, such as releasing a changing-mindset campaign, to help society deal with this situation.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .
To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .
On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way .

Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The topic of gay marriage merely failed to be discussed. However, when it comes to whether gay marriage should be allowed legally, individuals hold divergent views. As far as I am concerned, the government should treat gay marriage as a legal thing.
Undoubtedly, gay marriage can be beneficial. First of all, it is able to shrink the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. For instance, some countries which allow gay marriage legally have become well-known tourism sites now by attracting foreign gays to come. Thus, their tourism industry can be thrived and the moribund local economy can be turned into the resurgent one, which may help to avoid turning the gap into gulf. Additionally, allowing gay marriage to be legal is also able to undermine the crime rate. On condition that some gays cannot enjoy the right of marriage, they may feel underrated, underprivileged and underappreciated, which may give them the predisposition to revenge the society to express their resentment and dissatisfaction. What is more, the government is able to diminish cultural conflict through making gay marriage a law. Provided that some individuals get little acquainted with gay culture, they may deem it as aggressive. However, by admitting it as a low, we can minimize such vulnerability and promote the mutual understanding of divergent cultures.
On the other hand, treating gay marriage legally also has various disadvantages. Firstly, it may undermine family rapport for the reason that some family members may not willing to accept gay marriage, which may cause the increasingly indifferent among family members and finally lead to family skirmish and splintering. In addition, some young individuals are possible to make mistakes at an early age if the government makes gay marriage law. It is widely acknowledged that some young people are not mature enough to choose the right partner. Provided that they get married at an early age, they may suffer irreversible loss.
To sum up, although there are some disadvantages to let gay marriage be legal, the benefits of it are multifaceted. Considering the development of the economy and culture, I agree with allowing gay marriage to be a legal option.",5.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In recent years, the crisis of food wasting has drawn the attention from all over the world. In my perspective, there are reasons to this problem and some measures should be taken into effect to reduce the amount of wasted food.
Franklly speaking, based on my observation, there are several factors that leads to the food-wasting crisis. Firstly, with the aid of modern technology, especially those related to farming industry, we can get much more stable access to all kinds of crops than our predecessors, which means we no longer need to live in a food-saving lifestyle, thus leading to a number of wastes in terms of food. Secondly, due to lack of educations on saving food in school, the youngsters nowadays tend to be unaware of the importance of adequete food. As a result, people are used to order more amount of food than they actually need, constituting more food is wasted everyday. Finally, as the burgeon of economy in most countries, the fashion of showing off to others is curved into the mind of pubilc, resulting a number of extravegent consuming that could cost plenty of food wasted.
Since the problem of food wasting is taking place everywhere around the globe right now, it is urgent for us to take some actions to deal with the problem. In my opinion, as it is impossible to reverse the development of science, we should then focus on educaitions, specifically children's education. For example, several lectures could be given to the elementary school students to highlight the hardships to grown crops for our ancestors, as well as the reason why we should save the food we eat everyday. On top of that, the autorities could organise the student for some visits to the farming field, where they can learn the basic knowledges needed for farming industry and then understand how harsh it is to grow food that is sold on market nowadays. Once the children aware of the importance of saving food, there certainly will be less food thrown away on a day to day basis.
To sum up, both technologies and lack of public education give birth to food wasting. Althogh several methods could be taken to deal with the problem, it is through our joint effort to reduce the food thrown away everday. Actions need to be implemented swiftly.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Information technology is one type that has already changed a lot from the past. Information technology influences our daily life in many areas, such as home, leisure, and work activities. It positively affects human life, but it also has its disadvantage. I will give my opinion about how information technology influences our lives and the information technology has more benefit or cause more detriment.
Information technology improves human life in many different areas. First, it reduces the difficulty of communication. The technology we have right now gives us a faster and easier way to communicate with other who is far from us. Right now, whether we use social media or email, we can contact the people who are far from us immediately. The second part is information gathering; right now, we can get news everywhere, just on electronics, such as cell phones and TV. Also, information technology helps humans in information storage and process. This is the advantage of information technology.
Information technology significantly improves human life, but it also has some disadvantages. The first thing is to reduce the time people commute together face by face. Nowadays, classes, meetings, and work can all go online. As a result, we have less chance to meet and communicate; this reduces the ability to watch others' behavior and expression to speculate their feeling and emotion. The second disadvantage is that convenient technology lets people rely on it too much and reduces our ability to finish jobs without technology.
In my opinion, the advantage of information technology has way more influence on human life than the disadvantages. First, it helps us solve our problems with more accessible and faster information. This meets the fast rhythm of life in this era. Also, information technology may let people rely on it, but this is very general for humans because we always use anything we can use to solve problems quicker and more efficiently. This is how information technology influences our life.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

I completely agree that assigned homework can put unhealthy stress on children. However, there is one significant benefit of giving young school children homework in moderation, provided that they are not assessed traditionally as they are today.
In regards to giving children a redundant amount of homework, there are some drawbacks to consider. Many people, especially parents, are worried for their childrens quality of life when they are expected to perform outside of school classes. This can be because some children show a range of symptoms connected to performance anxiety, which might be caused by their own expectations of achieving certain grades. Since they are taught on an everyday basis that they have to perform on a high level at school, in order to satisfy the teacher, they are at risk of not experiencing the positive aspects of being a child.
By contrast, many other adults argue that home assignments plays a vital role in childrens´ life, so they are adequately educated from an early stage. The significant advantage of implementing homework in elementary school is that pupils will learn study strategies and be able to familiarise themselves with the concept, before the homework becomes more difficult as they get older. If they would not be handed out homework tasks at all, they may find themselves in a situation where they are not able to keep up the pace.
In conclusion, while I strongly agree that putting a immense amount of pressure on young school children by grading their works is contraproductive, I think home assignments are necessary to give children an opportunity to adjust to how school works in real life. In other words, teachers should not grade childrens homework to release some of their pressure, instead they should assess tasks by speaking about their weaknesses only.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.
There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.
The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.
Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.",7.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

In this essay, I disagree that lucrative wealth makes citizens careless about anything because they are developing their country. Additionally, I will talk about how economic wealth had changed the life of people in their countires. There are numerous reasons why economic wealth is prominent even though if the country is rich they could be richer.
Firstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. Because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. Some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. Because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life. Moreover, living in a rich country gives a priority for a good life.
Furthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. Having a high economic wealth could change the life of people. All of the people are greedy no matter what you do they want more and more, therefore, people are developing their county to have a high salary and live a tranquil life.
To conclude, having an increase of economic wealth in a country changes the lives of citizens. People are trying to develop the countries to make it more knownable and a prominent figure in life.

In my humble opinion, I consider big-city life to be harmful.
A row of arguments can prove this point of view. The air and water pollution in cities tend to provoke a spectrum of lung and skin diseases. A number of people encountering lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, eczema and psoriasis prevails in megapolicies compared to small towns and villages. Even I have acquired chronic bronchitis while leaving in Moscow. It also must be mentioned that constant contamination of enviroment has long-term consequence for human genetics. For instance, several decades ago the phenomena of allergy was not so widespread. And nowadays, several hundred thousands of people are suffering from it, as their immune system responds inadequately to ordinary things, such as animal fur or dust.
On the contrary, the medicine level in small villages cannot be compared with medicine in large cities. Some urgent problems such as limb break, infection, serious inflammation, heart attack, seizures or appendicits can be tackled only in large cities, where you can call an ambulance and it will come in a blink of an eye, while in countyside it can cause a dramatical outcome. My friend's grandpa in a distant village broke a rib and it stabbed his lung, and, unfortunately, ambulance did not make it in time.

While there are little advantages for some countries throwing such a sports event, I am convinced that holding an international sports event benefits the hosting country.
On the one hand, there are several reasons why in some situations people think it is bad for a country to host an international sports event. In the first place, average people draw more attention to daily necessities and medical treatments. They believe hosting such an event is of little value compared with basic infrastructure and amenities. Instead, they hold that if invested in economic development and recovery, the good effects will be doubled. Presumably, if a country , like Afghanistan and Iraq, host an international sports event regardless of its capacity, the country will lose its people's faith because after a war, people all want to fill their belly and want the famine to be eradicated.
On the other hand, throwing an international sports event can be a great means of developing a country's economy. Hosting an international sports event spurrs the economy and provide large quantities of employment for people, which revives and thrives all various industries. Apart from that, a sports event held by a country advocates the theme of health and sports, encouraging people there to lead a green positive attitude towards life, as well as setting up its renowned international position. Therefore, after the event, excellent businessman and geniuses all around the world will be attracted to invest there.

2,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.
It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles' development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.",7.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.
First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.
Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.
But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.
In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works.

Living in a large metropolitan can bring many challenges to one's health. When you live and work in a never-ending rat race there can be consequences to your health becasue of the continuous stress brought on by increased workload, longer working hours and very little time to rest.
There is also an increase in pollution due to the high density of people, cars and other carbon immisions.
I agree to an extent that living in a big city can bring about its challenges to your health, however, there are many more advantages to living in a major city when ones health takes a dip rather than being ill in a rural or outlying area. Getting sick and having health issues is not bound by an area you live in. These things happen to us no matter where we live. Living stress free in a rural area does not take away the fact that I may carry a cancer gene.

2,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is no doubt the truth that the majority of people want to live in a society where they can derive a sense of satisfaction. While people are ceaselessly struggling to improve society to meet their needs, there is almost always some problems or issues that remain and keep society from being better. In this essay, I try to examine the reason why it is a highly challenging and even impossible task to create an ideal society and give some measures that might be helpful to mitigate the situation.
The first step is to understand why the goal of an ideal society is tough to achieve. One of the most apparent reasons is that it is nearly not possible to give an explicit definition of ideality. Since the desire of each person can be extremely different and individual, their expectations of what an excellent society should look like are immensely varied and sometimes incompatible with each other. For instance, some people wish to have a society of fewer foreign immigrants because of the eventual rise in crime and the more intensive competitiveness in the job market, while others insist that a multicultural society certainly brings vast amounts of merits to the future. Another obvious reason is in terms of the difficulty of realizing the requirements. A prime example is eliminating discrimination against gender or sexual orientation. Although a lot of related laws have been introduced to protect the vulnerable population from being discriminated against, this issue remains one of the most significant concerns that people have and need to face every day.
Despite the complexity and challenges of creating the ideal society for everyone, there is still a large number of things that can be done to enhance the expectations of people toward the society where they live. In my opinion, an ideal society includes at least great tolerance. I believe that education, especially in primary school and kindergarten, plays an essential role in teaching how to treat others with respect, which benefits the tolerant atmosphere in society significantly. One measure that government should leastwise take into account is to fund the more meaningful projects at the school, which publicize and advocate the value of fairness, justice, and kindness.
To sum up, although it might not be possible to create a society that satisfies the whole population regarding the huge diversity of attitudes people hold toward the key consideration of an ideal society, there is still highly necessary to make every effort to make it a better one for all.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"Striving for own career development is most of the people's lifetime target in the modern city. In some nations, employees spend long time at work becomes a phenomenon. This essay is going yo discuss the reasons behind and I reckon that this is a negative development for both the companies and employees.
There are two main reasons behind this phenomenon. Firstly, it could be the corporate culture of the company. The management members of the company may agree that workers spending a long period of time in the office equals to excellent performance. For instance, employees in Japanese company could get a greater annual bonus or better chance to promote if they are eager to work for a long hours. This forces the employees to to show up in the office just because of giving a good impression to the boss.
Secondly, as the competition between different companies in the market is nervous, coporate sectors are willing to push their colleagues to enhance their sales or performance. It causes a great pressure to the employees whom need to work for long hours to fuifill the expectation from the managements. For example, product sales agents' performance depends on the sales number quarterly. If the agent cannot sale the products effectively, they will receive less revenues or even being sacked.
As per the reasons stated, I absolutely think that it is a negative development for both the employees and companies. It is because it gives the unnecessary pressure to the colleagues which will affect their mental health. Inversely, it downgrades the performance of the employee as well as the company.

2,Write about the following topic.Few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.
Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.
Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.
Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.
This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.
In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.",8.0,7.5,"Scores: 7, 8"
2,"When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree)","When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response.

This in turn has entailed various repercussions on people's lives. In this essay I will be trying to address a few pitfalls that might be resulted from the rising dependence on cars, and then I will try to consolidate some available solutions.
With the recent development in the car industry, private cars have been quite affordable products for a large portion of the society. Therefore, most of the people have started to travel by their own cars toward their destinations. This increase in vehicles traveling in the streets has alarmingly caused many traffic jams, and these in turn have costed the national economics enormous lost work hours. Moreover, the extent of the air pollution has been widened as a result of the increasing toxic materials emitted into the air. In addition, number of traffic accidents apparently has seen an expected surge, since it has a proportional relation to cars quantities travelling within the cities.
In order to minimize the problems mentioned above, a few solutions can be offered. First, governments should pour more money into developing the public transportation infrastructures, which might encourage employees to forgo their private cars and alternatively take the bus or train. Other notion which merits consideration, employers should intervene and organize group transits for transferring workers from and to their homes. In tourism circles, if there had been more focus on group packages, many tourists would have preferred to leave their cars at home.
In conclusion, I truly am of the opinion, that governments should take significant actions in order to decrease the use of private cars within their countries, in order to solve some of the inevitable problems resulted from the over-reliance on cars.",7.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

Speaking about traffic problems, I always think about Moscow. No town I have ever been in has such a big trouble with road traffic. A huge quantity of public transport types, a few cars for one family, all of it creates a constant flow of traffic.
Of course the increase popularity of IT-jobs and freelance helps people to spend more time home. The Home-office concept appeared relatively recently but a lot of people choose it already. I think after pandemic this type of work will be the only viable option.
The same situation is observed with education process. The almost a year pupils and students spend in Zoom and Skype. It's hard for me to say if online study has the same quality as a physical communication with the teacher in the audience. But the time savins are obvios.
I can't disagree that home office and online studies will help us to avoid daily traffic jams. But also I wouldn't say that it's the only way.
When city infrastructure gives me a possibility to get to the place by foot, I would love to do it. If the city provides an opportunity to ride bicycles or scooters a lot of people would try it. In this way some people will leave the car at the garage. It seems to me that alternative types of transport become more popular each day.

2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In primary school, especially in the countryside in Japan, primary students have an opportunity to learn how to plant and grow vegetables. In addition, students need to feed and observe animal growth and health. This is a great advantage for children to enrich their knowledge of how essential our lives consist in society. It is obviously advantageous than disadvantages.
Firstly, the procedures to grow vegetables take a long time from cultivating the soil to harvesting vegetables when they grew up. This means that it is great education for children on how to produce our food and agriculture industries have been paying an outstanding effort and time. This education causes students to become aware of the necessity of gratitude to people who are working in these industries.
In addition, it is also mandatory to keep animals in a good condition is worthwhile as young as possible. Animals also have lives, and their lives easily devastate unless they are fed. This is also the same in human lives. Young children will be able to recognize how sensitive to keeping animals a good condition, and be more respectful to their own parents and how deep love they give to children. As a result they are more willing to give a hand who need help.
Finally, these activities, such as growing vegetables and keeping animals are not only helpful to learn what our society consists of, but also more educational for children firsthand, instead of watching documental TV programs. Through these activities, children will become aware of current issues, for example, food consumerism, extinction of animal species, global warming, and so on. If they learned as young as possible, the number of people who are concerned and make specific actions for these issues will increase. As a result, our lifestyle will improve more peacefully.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays in many educational buildings bullying is became an enormous issue. From my point of view, the causes of this problematic way to act in a community are multiple. It might be due to family issue, bad example from the society, social media and so on. Despite the origine of this behaviour, it should not be tollerate, but punished.
To start with, bullying is a fundamental issue in the youngester society that needs to be tackled as soon as possibile in order to guarantee to the pupils a better childhood. One of the reason why a scholar acts in that way could be found in the household environment. If parents are violent with their child, it could potentially lead the student to act aggressively towards his/her fellows in order to release the anger accumulated at home. Another example that can provoke this type of behaviour is in the society idols. Promote bullying in series tv, movies or throught social media can misguide the idea of right and wrong in a pupil's mind.
Having said that, possible solutions to avoid children acting as bullys can be addressed. Firstly, in schools schould exist a zero tollerance policy towards this concept. Secondly, It should be put in place some code of conduct to direct scholars to understand which behaviour is accepted. Thirdly, they could be helped with counseling with a psycologist. Least but not last, bullying should be condemned. Educational institute might not erase this issue, but they can tackle it teaching good discipline and penalizing pupils who act badly.
To sum up, in order to address the right solutions, that can be different from one child to another, school schould understand the cause of bullying throughout counseling and then help the student out.",6.5,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"

Some peple - including lawyers - believe the accused person's past is very important. I completely argee with it and in this essay I will support my piont of view with some arguments.
Firstly, without knowing defectant's past, he could to throw everyone off the scent. Persons who are being accused of the crime usually try to soften their sentence. Tey are capable to lie about many things to avoid the prison.
Secondly, the defectant can have criminal record in past, so with having access to accused's background the point about this could help in researching the dicision of the case. For this part, is also possible to mention than criminal persons could intentionally go to the prison for some common case such as steeling somebody's property, to avoid of punishment of anything more serious and horrible like murdering or unlegal human trafickking. and in thhis moment the defectant's past is mostly important than ever!
Anothe reason why I agree with a jury should be given all the past facts are cases when the accused peron where slandered and because of missing few background details an innocent man might be convicted. In other words, in reason of unawarenes can interfere with judgement.
On the other hand, any personal problems cannot be presented as strong argument for acquittal of a crime.

One of the biggest health concern could come form air polutions, as big cities likely to have heavy trafics, especially in the third would coutries. However, in the developed coutries, many cities have as same amonut of trafics as suburban areas, or evern less. For example, many big cities in developed coutries charges a lot for parkings.

However, I agree that people living outside the cities, especialy wher surrounded by natures will have more cleaner air. Also having more space to exercise, compare to people living in cities may assist in being able to maintain their health.

Actually i completely disagree that the act of failing is caused by a lack of desire and motivation. There are many different factors which influence our failure and success.
Firstly, the most recent event which affected significantly most of people's motivation, is the Covid-19 pandemic. The last two years there the number of business failure increased significantly due to lockdowns and victims by pandemic. For example the first lockdown in Europe happened in Italy in 2020, which restaurants, leisure facilities and shopping centres were obliged to close for more than one year. The consequence of this, was the loss of customers and the accumulation of debt, which led to many failures, because people had difficulties paying their bills and taxes.
On the other hand, failure could happen if people has no desire to expand their horizons. For example many developed companies that accept paying their employees larger amount of money, this action could cause laziness to company's members, even they could be absent from work. All that happens because of complacency. Consequently this can amount in dismissal and ruin their job's career and reputation in terms of work experience.

There is a variety of advantages because the number of English speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. I strongly agree with this phenomenon.
To go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.
Fortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""Club House"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. Therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our English skill.
In contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. In Iceland, although there is a native language, ""Icelandish"" language still remains and is spoken in Iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. According to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in English, instead of Icelandish. Therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national Media such as, podcast, radio, TV broadcast are only spoken in Icelandish language.

I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.
The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.
On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.

While many agree that parents are responsible for managing their children's free time, the others argue that the kids themselves should be entitled to make their own decisions. As a grown up, I personally believe that the kids should be allowed to select activities based on their preferences within the scope provided by the parents, as per the following reasons.
To begin with, no one likes to be forced. After long days of either tiresome work or study, everyone wants to enjoy their time afterwards. This also applies to the students, which in many cultures, are put into after school classes to spend more time tutoring in order to catch up with the academic standards. Although some can endure this intense lifestyle, most of the time, these schedules usually cause the kids to be overworked and stressed. Therefore, it is important to spare some times for the children to manage their own activities. Nevertheless, unlike adults who are financially independent, the kids can be subjected to many limitations.
Despite being able to participate in many activities, the underages must be legally supervised by several reasons, one of them being decision-making abilitiy. Parents can play a very important part in disapproving activities that are inappropriate for the kids. For example, if not accompanied or consulted, children can end up meeting with strangers or playing dangerous extreme sports. Furthermore, most of the time, the underages usually rely on their parents' earnings, which lead back to them approving the recreational budgets.
All in all, it is necessary to allow the kids to have autonomy over their free time as it allows them to develop sense of responsibility along with discovering their interests.

This essay will state some specific examples and analyze the consequences.
First, literature fans are declining sharply. Decades before, people willingly invested considerable time and energy on reading and studying Jean Austin and Charles Dickens. Literature clubs were appealing, constantly filled with true Shakespear lovers, among whom there were real experts. Unfortunately in recent time book stores do not favor the complete works of Dickens any more for it does not make much profit, and many literature clubs have their doors shut due to members have greatly decreased.
Also, it is obvious that sports have been losing popularity. For instace, even about 5 years ago, there were much devoted football fans, and almost every football club had a considerable number of faithful fans. People were more than happy to anticipate the match results and purchase match tickets and lotteries. However it is not the case any more. People are reluctant to stay in the stadium watching a 2-hour football match, which is proven by the constant nearly empty statiums.
These phenomena will bring several negative effects on both individuals and the society. First, many people will lose the ability of appreciating masterpieces of great authors like those listed above. Moreover, there would be fewer parents who like to buy their children novels of Austin or selective works of Shakespear, and thus among the next generation much more people may find ""Pride and Prejudice"" unfamiliar, and ""Romeo and Juliet"" alien to them.
People losing interest in sports can be a heavy blow to the economy. If fans do not watch the matches, some football clubs would be on the brink of bankcrupt. The government will also lose a great amount of tax derived from sports industry.

Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.
To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.
Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.
In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children.

Building highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training, give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics, for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers, it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions.
On the other side providing various sport centers for the public use will encourage people to train and practice all kinds of sports more which leads to gaining more athletes to represent the country, for example allowing and giving access to a young talented girls to practice their favorite sport like football, ice skating, bascketball and more will give them the apportinety to become a professional athletes who would benifit and represent the country.
In conclusion, i think both invisting in building specialised facilities to train the top athletes to win and host an international compititions, and invisting in providing sport centers for everyone to use to encourage and build more athletes could be benificial and counribue a highly international achievement in sports for the country it self.",6.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"

There are a lot of web-services which will help to create your own genealogical tree. Some people even hire a special agent, who help them to invistegate some information from various source of infromation.
But why do people do this? In my opinion, there are two main arguments. First of all, some country offer a citizenship for people with specific roots. For example, if you have Jewish roots, you can recieve Israel citizenship. For repatriation you need to have just a quater Jewish roots, it means, that your grandmother or grandfather must be Jewish. Sometimes it could be really difficult to provide it, but genealogical tree is a good support. Second reason why do people explore their history is just curiosity. It is really intresting to understand who were your ancestors. Maybe they were just labor or fermers, but maybe they were very famous people.
In my opinion, this is positive, that people are intresting in their history. As I see, when people are interested in their own history, they become more involved in history of their country or even in world history. In general, history is very important subject, because it could give general overview on how our society works. Also, creating family tree is good oportunity to establish relationship with distint relatives and spend excellent time with your familly.

2,Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?,"Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life's pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.",8.0,7.5,"Scores: 7, 8"

And others strongly argue that keep changing is more important to catch up with this society. Although some peoples opinion, working the same things feel relieved and stable in their life, I strongly recommend it is necessary to keep changing, and practicing to get along with this fast paced society.
It is often stated that some people are willing to work on monotonous tasks, and keep doing the same tasks is commendable, and be taken as the virtue, especially in Japan. For example, there are sophisticated handcrafts and the craftsmen are often valued and praised to some extent. Therefore, some jobs, including traditional crafts are necessary to maintain Japanese great culture.
On the other hand, technology has been developing in recent years. Robot and IT technology have drastically improved in a few decades. Surprisingly, some robots started to serve meals to customers' tables in some restaurants in Japan. This means that technology will take the place of many jobs which used to be handled by people. Therefore, people need to upskill in a variety of work for the future.
Finally, it is unpredictable which industries and jobs are no longer necessary by human work or other industries will appear in the future. The only thing people can do is observe and predict the social environment, and update their own skills. For example, if people perceived IT programming will be more demandable, and working the same tasks in the factory will be taken by a robot, they should start learning IT programming and other demandable skills as soon as possible.
In conclusion, people kept updating their own skills from ancient times. Therefore, people are required to change their lifestyles, and jobs to meet the rapid social improvements and changes. As a result, people will get used to this pace and be more creative.",5.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","Rules and laws are important for society to functioning well in right path, if people do whatever they want freely in regular life then it might lead society to malfunction. This essay will argue why I completely reckon that laws are entirely needed for uplifting of civilisation.
There are plethora of reasons why rules and laws have implication of lifestyles. First and foremost reason is that, crime, accidents and environment. If there are not certain rules about crime then people definitely do many criminal activities in each and every place , so other persons do not fell secure and safe. If people have freedom for whatever they want to do then , it will very dangerous for society as well as environment. Secondly, young generation could not differentiate what is right or wrong without the teaching of rules. For example, if official authorities could freely get implicated in money laundering from the national budgets and not encounter any punishment , then possible results in the political, economic and social turmoil in the country.
Moreover, if there are no traffic rules then the situation of roads will not be imagined by anyone. The drugs are legal in countries then it is mainly effect on young generation's future and they will never know about right things. Pollution is only controlled by the Government's rules. If there are no any rules then human can not imagine the pollution level in the air.
On the contrary, some people think that, rules and laws are unnecessary for their rights. If people aware about, what is good or bad for society, environment and themselves then it is not issue about laws and rules. However, many persons really can not understand about rules , so the Government made for people's peace and safety. Regulation is key that perfectly handle people's life in particular manner.
To put in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, rules and laws are essential for the functioning of society. If citizens are given freedom to do whatever they like, then they will not only fall into bad habits but also creat confusion and nuisance in society as well as nation.",5.5,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As population grows and society expands, noise pollution inevitably occurs more often and worse. This concept triggered some people to start thinking that there oughts to be strict regulations on how much noise each individual can make in order to minimise the harmful effect on other people. In this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of the regulations and suggest whether it is beneficial or not after all.
One of the advantages if strict laws are applied is that it is the easiest and most effective way of solving the problem in a short term. The noise level of human population will significantly drop as being loud becomes an illegal action to carry out. For instacne, even imposing a fine due to excessive sound one made can strongly discourage him or her from making loud noises ever again. Furthermore, people's standard of living will most likely to be enhanced as there are less disturbance caused by noise. People will be able to enjoy quiet, relaxing weekends even in central cities, for example.
In contrast to the preceding positive outcomes, there are disadvantages due to the strict laws such as too much restrictions on people. The laws can be considered as rather aggressive and coercive since people's some daily life routines may get spoiled. Some hobbies like singing and even special cases like emergency situations will confront some problems if such laws become real. Moreover, it is almost impractical to set up the standard of 'loud' noise or even measuring the decibels individulas make all the time. Society would get rather intensive and monotonous once the laws controlling the sound level are implemented.
In summary, despite the efficient aspects of the laws, it is more important to acknowledge the negative sides such as stress individuals suffer from strict regulations or damages on their lifestyle. Noise pollution should be resolved through more friendly means like advertisement rather than inflexible laws.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence people's health and capacity for work?","The role of colors in our psycological life is crucial. Some people suggest hence to pay attention on color schemes when workplaces or hospital are decorated. I agree that colors affect people's psychological health. A particular place's decoration can arouse a determinate feeling that could favour or penalise the capacity of people in a work place.
Colors affect our psycological life. They possess an extraordinary social role. It is not a case that the famous table of emotions is presented in different colors where the different colors represent different emotions. For instance, blue incline people to be sad while red is said to be the color of passion, and move strongly the emotions of a person by setting of her pleasures. Lastly the grey's shades stimulate anxiety. Therefore, I think that the hospital's walls or officies cannot be decorated in grey or blue as long as it is better to stimulate their positiveness and productivity. Thre is a curious story about Princess Sissi, that confirm the impact of color in our life. She was obsessed about her wight and fitness. For this reason, she decored purple all the walls of her appartmanets. Indeed, pourple is said to be the color which stimulates the absence of hunger. Thus, when the princess was there it was easier for her to be fast.
By contrast, there are also some colors that stimulate fantasy, creativity and peace. Green is one of that color. Then, to decorate hospitals with green shades could be a good way to produce positive vibes in people who are sicks. Moreover, yellow is defined as the color that describes the feeling of being proud, aware and confident. Then, using this color in the walls of the officies will stimulate workers to do their better. Their capacity in the work-place will be maximased by the general environment.
In conclusion, I believe that colors affect our psychological life and then people should pay attention in the feelings they stimulate when they decore a room or a building intented to welcome a particular type of people like sicks people or workers. Psychological life is important and relevant as the physical one and colors can affects our moods as well as physical accidents do.",5.5,5.5,"Scores: 6, 5"

Some people, in order to face this issue, assume that every country should aim at producing more materials and goods.
I do not concur with this statement.
Rather than increase the production of goods and materials, a country ought to sensibilize its citizens not to dismiss goods that are still able to function properly.
Getting rid of goods that still work just because the new one has been released forces every country to produce more and more good, leading to a worsening of our enviroment.
Another pivotal factor that I would like to underline is the fact that people from developed countries do not have a shortage of goods. Not at all.
Consumerism is predominant in these areas and thus these countries should reduce their productions.
Most of the things they use daily are useless and they serve as amusement. I firmly believe a person can live perfectly without having 5 different cars.
In my opinion, the fact that a country should aim at increasing its production of materials and goods has another leak that I have briefly mentioned before: a higher level of production would lead inevitably to a higher level of pollution that would be consequently released into the natural environment.
Eath is already facing some very important issues when it comes to problems related to pollutions.

For me, I strongly agree with this view and wil give my reasons in the essay below.
The main reason that I agree with this statement is about socializing. Everyone knows that humans are social animals. That means they cannot live alone in society, especially kids. Outdoor activities can help them to talk with other people or play with other kids, including making friends. Moreover, childhood is the age of learning something new. They will learn something new all the time from us which can make them have a good attitude when they grow up. While playing games make themes lost of self-awareness for surrounding. As a result, outdoor activities teach children to be a good socializing
Another reason that I hold this view is about health. As I talk in the previous paragraph, childhood is the age of not only learning something new but also trying. Outdoor activities in terms of sports such as football or basketball can help not only connect with other kids but also make them healthy. Compared with playing computer inside their room which makes them diminish and hurt their eyesight. As it can be, children will have a good physical health form outdoor activities.

Although there are some benefits to the education system which specialize in some specific subject, I think to learn wide range of subjects until they leave school.
For example, there are some courses which focus on some specific industry in Japan. Specifically, it is geared toward hair stylists, IT programming, and entertainment. It is useful for them to learn the specific curriculums earlier might be advantageous to master these techniques. Especially, when it comes to entertainment, younger talented people tend to be evaluated higher than older talented people.

In addition, people have often required a variety of educational knowledge in daily conversation, especially in the workplace. This means that learning a wide range of subjects is helpful to bear out their variety of educational backgrounds.
Finally, it might be difficult for teenagers, especially fifteen years old students to decide which occupation, and industry they would like to work. Teenagers have often deluded and changed their idea about which occupation is suitable for them, however, they have some specific dreams in advance. Therefore, learning a wide range of subjects will be helpful to decide a variety of occupations in the future.

This essay will discuss both of the benefits and drawbacks of the experiences of one year adventure in foreign countries for young people.
To start with, there are several advantages to this adventure abroad. Firstly, young people can meet people from different cultures, beliefs, and ages, and broaden their thoughts and experiences of the world. For instance, they may have cultural shock and reflect their own views and values about life and the world. In this way, they may become more open-minded and tolerant of different people and cultures. Secondly, they can make friends with people in other countries and broaden their social networks. This can become long-term friendships and they can gain a global perspective of the world. This is not only beneficial for themselves, but it can also benefit their societies and countries in long run as well.

Numerous reports in the media about unfortunate cases that young people in foreign countries being kidnapped, forced to consume or sell drugs, and even being killed. It could be dangerous for them if they meet local gangster bands and have no one to rescue them. Therefore, it is essential that young people take precautions to keep their safety while abroad.
To sum up, although there are potential risks in the one-year journey, the advantages of broadening their horizons of thoughts, becoming open-minded, and experiences of forming new friendships with people in other countries could outweigh the disadvantages if the young people take measures for their safety while abroad.",7.5,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"

Partly, I agree that money is the most important factor which makes people stay in their job.
The reason is because we work in order to be able to purchase our daily needs. It's undeniably true that we need money to sustain our daily life. We have to use our money to pay our bills such as foods, electricity, debt and other basic needs. Furthermore, we know that the number of the number of inflation keeps increasing this year due to the unstabilty of the economic circumstance which results in the increament of goods prices. Having said that, money becomes very essential reason to stay in the company because it really helps us to afford a better life.

The important aspect is the working environment. Aside from money, we have to make sure that we can improve our skills in the current employment. By having a positive and supportive working environment, we will be able to maximize all of our capabilities which can make us a better person professionally.

Humans are social creatures and technology is helping us to socialize with others world-wide. Computers and the internet are the two products of technology that we use to connect with our friends, families and people. Despite where we live in, in today's world, we are able to talk with our friends almost anytime we want it.

We can search the information in these platforms rather than going to public libraries, and they would provide in a short period. This speed can help us to improve and gain more information.
However, we can find ourselves at our offices or homes, sitting in front our laptop all day and completing our tasks with a little effort. This habit would makes us lazy and inactive people.

However, I am inclined to believe that the increase of elderly people will be under control. While many challenges are likely to taken place, there will be effective ways to manage this civil segment with the cooperation of both government and private sectors.
As the elderly population is expanding, the demand for nursing homes or elders' clubs are on the increase. To meet this demand, private sectors are investing on this type of institutions and services as they foresee the lucrative profit these businesses can probably generate in the near future. Apparently, young people are occupied with their daily job which makes it impossible to take care of their parents or grandparents. Therefore, sending the elderly to nursing homes or hiring personal care service are reasonable options to be consider.
Another reason to validate my opinion is the balance in labor force. While some developed countries are experiencing aging population, the scenario is opposite in developing countries whose birth rate is considerably high. As a result, many developed countries such as Germany have encouraged a welcoming entry of those young laborers into its nursing industry. One of my friend has been settling in Germany following her moving to the country 5 years ago to become a nursing staff in privately-owned elderly clubs.
Last but not least, government interference in elderly care is highly recommended. It is suggested that the government allocate more budget to establish publicly-owned elderly homes to mitigate the financial burden to acquire this service. Moreover, regulations on pension plan should be properly adjusted and taken more seriously by employers so that people are assured financially when they are retire.

2,People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,"It is undeniable that crime inevitably contributes to negative consequences to society, which affects in various aspects. Hence, there is a belief that giving longer prison sentences could be the most effective way to reduce the crime rate. Nevertheless, there are also opponents who believe that other effective mitigations are also available which I personally agree with.
It is true that being sentenced for a very long period is what people do not want to experience. A criticism in favor of this is that those who live in prison will lack freedom. This is because prisoners will be forced to stay in jail only, meaning that they could not meet their companions as well as traveling to another country until the end of the prison term. Another common example which supports the idea of increasing the sentence term is that prisoners will be under control by authorities all time. Living in this condition would possibly result in the loss of privacy, which is the experience that people tend to avoid.
In spite of the fact that giving longer sentences seems to be effective, other solutions could also be applied. A classic example is that people who break the laws must pay an extremely high penalty to governments. Since people do not want to lose their money, this policy is likely to encourage people to follow the laws, leading to the declining number of crime. Another potential solution could be done by schools to teach young generations about the effects of crime. Once students understand that committing crime would lead to the lower standard of living of people in communities such as reducing in the neighbors' safety, they tend to behave in the opposite way which is to improve the living conditions of other people instead and this would have hugely positive impacts in the long term.
In conclusion, despite the fact that being in prison for a long time is a completely terrible experience for people because of no flexibility and privacy in life, it seems to me that other alternatives which are paying higher fines and educating young people with respect to negative effects of crime tend to be more effective. This is because these solutions are likely to address the root cause of committing crime and tend to be more applicable in the long run.",7.0,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"

Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.
For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.

However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.
On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.
On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.
As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.",7.0,5.5,"Scores: 5, 6"

Although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens, I strongly agree with this opinion.
To begin with, it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money. In Japan, they need to terminate to pursue their study at university, there are many students who study diligently though. If the government supported them financially, those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for.
In addition, some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries, such as IT, and Civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees. If governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free, the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees, and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university. This
means that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees.
Furthermore, economic growth is linked inextricably with education. If all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge, they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age. In addition, they will be able to study with working at the same time with light-hearted such as nighttime courses, and weekend courses. If they could work and study flexibly, they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work. If they are required to pay more tax due to the education fee by governments, they are more than happy to pay the tax for themselves and other ambitious students.

For example, gay marriage is contradict to the nature and could not has next generation, in the long term, leads the reduction of population and harms the growth of economic. In addition, the society has to consider about legal issue if gay marriage is accept . For example, if an legal gay family could adapt children? Who can prossess the asset and wealth from the gay couple?
However, the trend for supporting gay marriage has increased in recent decades, probably because of the equal-right campaign rapidly spreading in the world.

Some even believe same-sex marriage is also a nautre development which is long appearing in human history. Moreover, there is no evidence showing gay marriage would harm the society , rather to promote a multi-cultural, a society should accept different races, nationalties and gay people.
In my opinion, we should open our mind to accept gay marriage but we should also respect some religious person' s willingness.

It might be an extremely complicated choice, considering the skyrocketing rise of number of people in the world and the change in prefering a walk-distance city. This essay will explore the optimal solutions for cities layout.
Although the ideal solution might depend on what the cities are aiming for, under a generic point of view, it would be optimal to have dwellings compacted in a dimished size of land. The first justification is that cramping everything in a reduced area and growing tall allowes all the residents to reach shops and workplaces in dwindling time through walking, public transport or eco-friendly vehicles. Moreover, taking in account the overall incresing of population's density, with the creation of a taller layout, a sustainable market demand will be shown.
Nowadays, the antiquated method of construct residences on a wider area of land is not feasible. In most locations, cities are running out of vacant lands, in fact many single houses are occupying vast areas for luxury amenities for a limited family, when a building can be erected accomodating many households. Furthermore, an implementation in infrustracture, such as roads and parking, will be needed. If individuals are not able to arrive to destination without a private car, due to long distances to cover, more highway will be required, therefore more lands is taken away for agglomerate of dwellings and business offices.
To conclude, the world is shifting toward a highly populated areas, so that councils need to keep up to date with convinient cities layout, like skyscrapers rather than single houses, to ease people lifestyles and reduced citizens' footprint.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,"Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Champions have been heralded across cultures and religions for centuries. Hercules from Greek mythology and Samson from the Bible were known for their strength. Hermes, the messenger of the Greek gods adorned winged sandals to grant him the speed of wind. From ancient to current times, champions have shared their skills via sports. But a question has arisen. What takes presedence, brain or brawn?
For those who believe that physical strength is important for success in sport, we must consider the effort put into performing said activities. Running a marathon is easier said than done! Raising over 500kg above your head doesn't happen overnight, or rowing in appealing synchronization without training. Athletes train in gyms for countless hours by running on treadmills, strength training and doing plyometrics to develop the power in order to effectively perform their respective sports, thus proving the importance of physical strength to prevail in sports.
Others believe that in order to distinguish between the average and the greats, mental strength is the factor that does so. The amount of discipline, perserverance and other psychological strengths allow athletes to set world records. Former world's strong man, Eddie Hall has stated that he had used techniques from psychologists to unlock parts of the brain that provide super strength similar to that people use in life threatening situations to lift cars to save their children. He was able to become the first man to deadlift over 500kg. Though not as extreme, sportsmen and women must apply some form of mental strength to push themselves to achieve record-level excellence in sports.
I believe that brain and brawn harmoniously work together to create exceptional champions in sports. Physical strength is the baseline that allows athletes to perform their skills with endurance, and mental strength is the value needed to push them to go one step ahead of their competition. Sportmen must be able to run, lift, or even row without issue, as well as try, try, and try again, working through limiting beliefs so that they can become apart of sporting history.",8.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The use of products and goods with a lot of packaging is a highly controversial topic between people today. A lot of people believe it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce packaging of goods, while others believe that it is the individuals responsibility to avoid buying products with a lot of wrapping and packaging. I personally believe that it is the individuals responsibility to cease buying products with an increased amount of packaging, since a decrease in demand from customers could prevent further production of these goods.
The people that is of the opinion that it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging, believe that these companies have a moral obligation to preserve and protect the environment. In my country it is believed that these companies should be held responsible by the government. For example in Denmark the government provides manufacturers and stores with certain environmental regulations, which also include the amount of material these facilities are allowed to use for packaging. This helps reduce environmental harm and provides more responsibility to companies to reduce packaging.
However, the majority of people believe that this problem is an individual responsibility. This opinion considers that the moral obligation falls on the individual and not the company. The people who believe that it is an individual responsibility to not buy these products, believe that a decreased demand for products that harms the environment will lead to more environmentally friendly products produced.
To summarize, both of these opinions help reduce environmental harm. However, I believe that it is the individuals responisibility to not purchase overly packaged products, since this decrease in demand would lead to less production of these goods.",7.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

If we educate all students together regarthless of their different academic abilities we will be making a hughe mistake. Students with higher capacities will not be adressed in a propper way and it will discourage them. Smart students tend to get bored very fast and therefore special attention must be pay to them.
On the contrary, if we educate students based on their academic abilities we will not only see better results in the smarter ones, but we will also take better care of the students with more learning difficulties. By using this method the needs of the students will be adressed in a better way.
Education should have an indiviudal focus or at least in different groups, taking academic abilities degrees in account.

However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Having insects as food is not a new idea. In some Southeast Asia countries such as Thailand and Columbia, bugs like spiders and grasshoppers are common protein sources for the general public. To solve the food shortage in the growing population around the world, there is a voice to consume insect-based products instead of traditional meats. Meat industries have a negative reputation for being eco-unfriendly. Also, not all the family can afford to have meat. So is insect-based food a solution to the population booming era?
First of all, let us look into what insects take part in the ecosystem, Insects are at the bottom of the food chain. It means that many animals consume bugs as their main diet. One of the concerns of humans eating insects for food is whether the collection of insects will affect the environment. Over-collecting insects may endanger some species which rely on insects to survive. Farming insects may be an idea to grow insects for food but the impact on the farming environment is still under observation.
Food safety is another concern of eating insects. There are a few thousand kinds of insects, some of which are known as poison. Although most of the edible insects do not contain poison, identifying which kinds of insects are safe to eat will be an issue.
Nevertheless, eating insects can be an option. There are some countries that are mature in having insects. Whichever sources of the insects are safe and eco-friendly, insects can be a subsidy of proteins when lacking meat sources. However, there is still a long road for insects to become the main source of food in this state.",9.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

In this essay I am going to explain the two main views people hold on this subject.
A sizeable number of people argue that children would be best served by being taught at home rather than turning up at school , because of the highly comfortable and utterly familiar environment, which allow them to being involved into attending lessons as well as doing assignments more effectively and reducing distractions. As a result , thanks to the time-saving, the children may have enough time to spent for their leisure and sport activities.
However, many others beg to differ, claiming that a laptop cannot replace human touch without impacts negatively students performances, since the lack of direct relationship in that specific stage of age might be detrimental not only to children's school marks, but for themselves.
Moreover, those who hold this current of thought contend that being a student-at-home come at the cost of concentration, as such a comforting background may shift children focus toward more appealing activities, standing in stark contrast with the former view aforementioned.
To my mind, I believe that COVID experience has provided some insight that could help us to take the stock of the situation in this vein, namely, the flurry of psychological ailments of which the children were suffering during the lockdown were mostly sparked by their isolation toward their peers, it found.
Consequently, it means that relationship restriction would lead to depression which in turn, affects the mental processes underlying the school performances overall. Hence, it is reasonable to think that children are better off studying at school along with their mates rather than in a more reclusive way such as doing it alone at home.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an ""unquestioned benefit"". Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries' economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.",9.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.",6.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"

Although government and large companies have a huge impact on the environment, I totally disagree with the previous argument and I believe that each individual can help improving the environment.
Our environment is our resposibility, it is not only subjected to government or large companies.
In fact, I believe that each individual has his or her own duty toward the environment. If any individual throw any kind of waste on the streat, this will have a huge impact on the environment. if someone throw a plastic bottel for example, it might take thousands of years for the plastic to resolve. Instead people should have the knowledge about where they should throw their waste and always look for a recycle baskets. People should be aware about how harmful it is to the environment if they throw their waste elsewhere.
Other possible way for individuals to help improving the environment is by using recycable materials, for example paper bags instead of plastic bags. This attitude will encourage recycling. Another example of emproving environment by individuals is driving electrical mobiles ratherthan old cars and trucks. This way the toxic emissions will be reduced and that will help our atmosphere and prevent global warming.

Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.
One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens' opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone's opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.
The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.
In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs.

2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a contentious argument that the most effective method for young people to learn about cooperation is by doing team sports, rather than other alternatives. Despite the fact that doing sports as a team could inarguably strengthen collaboration skills of children, I personally believe that there are also other vital ways to upskill them in this aspect.
It is true that doing team sports could possibly lead to the collaboration of children. A classic example of this is that they have to jointly cooperate with other team members in order to achieve the team's goal. This is because reaching the goal in team sports requires each member to not only do their responsibility, but also to help other members to maximize the performance of the team. In addition, supporters of doing team sports may argue that children will also learn to communicate with other members, which is one of key factors for cooperation. As a result, when young people have better communication skills, they tend to be willing to collaborate with other people in any situation.
In spite of the aforementioned positive effects on juveniles with respect to the cooperation, the juveniles could also be encouraged to cooperate by working in a group as another alternative way. A common example of this is they have to think from other perspectives, which is an essential skill for collaboration. When juveniles work with other people, they would inevitably encounter with a wide variety of ideas which they might disagree with. Therefore, they have to understand the ideas from the others' point of view in order to reach a consensus. Furthermore, another key point for cooperation that adolescents will learn is delegation. This is because tasks that a group has to complete might requires various knowledge. Hence, adolescents have to delegate each task to each group member based on the expertise.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that doing team sport will positively result in the collaboration of children since they would get exposed to situations, requiring them to help and communicate with other team members. Nevertheless, I totally disagree with the notion that team sport is the best way to teach children to collaborate since doing assignment in a group could also teach and motivate them to cooperate with other people in terms of thinking from other points of view and work delegation.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

It is clear that People are usually different in their own characters and in their dealing with things. So that, some of them like to be alone and want to move on activities without sharing the others because they afraid of involving in troubles. They also think that the others may treat them jealously and enviously. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances of aggressive states inside learning circuses which sometimes made losing knowledge rather than winning new abilities. Moreover, those people may have deep fears and shy which constantly prevent them from growing among team works. For example many famous celebrities had become more creative by sitting alone. Such those ideas let people do not want to change their acceptable way in getting and learning skills for authentic life against team activities. In contrast, grouping work can overcome all obstacles in personality and teach people different kinds of skills.
Although some people can success in learning all they need individually, most of them whether their age and background eagerly need contacting the others to teach them lessons about realistic life skills. Cooperating concept is important in teaching people manners for adapting through life. As previous researches of Vojytsky has declared that learners always could build knowledge while interactions directly or indirectly with others. Overall the idea of sharing activities in order to give persons opportunity to learn values and new skills is completely true despite the minor improving of lonely ones' life.
This essay argued that it is had better getting bit new skills in team or group work ,on the other hand its useless way to teach people activities alone.

While this is a serious problem, it can be solved by keeping the proper line when we use artificial objects. In this essay, i will write the causes of temperatures rising and solution of these problems.
The main causes of temperature rising is human-made things. First, many people use air-conditional in summer and this can make glaciers melting. There is a study that too much uses of air-conditional are melting the glaciers. When the glaciers melt, the earth temperatures raise 4'C. In addition, nowadays, many people use cars when they go out. This can be a cause of rising temperature. This is because when we use cars, it spread the exhaust gas which influence to the air and temperatures.
However, there are solutions to this problem, one of the ways to solve temperature rising because of man-made is to use proper artificial things. When we use air-conditional in daily life. It is important to remain proper temperature, to 24-26'C. Also, we can wear light clothes instead of using gadgets. Furthermore, when we go to the place which has short distance, we can use bicycles or take a walk instead of cars. On the one hand, people can also use public transfortation when they go to their company.

Do the advantages of taking these risks outweigh the disadvantages?
I personally think that taking risks is inevitable in this day and age. There may be some drawbacks, but there it cannot be denied that there are certainly benefits.
Firstly, risks are necessary for us to move forward. Without risks, there would be no innovation, and without innovation, there will be no progress for humankind. Humankind is built on the foundation of risk-takers who not only achieved their goals of making the world a better place but also learnt to ability to get back up after their countless failures.
Secondly, by not taking the chance provided and taking a risk, they are missing out on amazing opportunities that could never be achieved unless you have the confidence, determination and conviction to follow the unknown path ahead. These opportunities could easily get them ahead in life, and they would never come true unless they stroll out of their conform zone.
Althought that is the case, it is undeniable that the amount of risk for professional and personal lives is vastly different. If they fail in their personal life, this could hurt in the short term, for example, you could need financial support if you had a family feud. This short-term loss could be a disadvantage in life, but it may not be as crucial as its effect on professional lives, for example, a career change could involve a big pay cut, which could be quite influential on professional lives.
Overall, taking risks could turn out to be a loss in the short term, but it is greatly outweighed by all the upsides taking a risk could bring.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

I think there might be some advantages to have a dress code, but disadvantages overweight benefits in this case.
First of all, dress code policy mandatory for some organisations' workers as it's part of the safety policy. For instance, workers of some scientific or technical labs should wear some specific dresses as their job is with the dangerous chemical elements. The absence of the protecting dress or some details, such as glasses or gloves, might be harmful for the employees. In this case, I believe to have harsh rules for the dress code, is essential.
Turning to the drawbacks of the dress code, I would mention that it might be uncomfortable and as a result effect on the employees' work quality. For instance, some banks require female employees to wear heels' shoes or male employees to have a tie. This kind of dresses or dress' elements might be not comfortable for the employees and as a result to have a psychological negative impact, such as lack of attention or willingnes to work properly . This will lead to the decrease of the work quality.
Another drawback of the dress code, is standartisation, when all employees should wear the company uniform with company logo. In this case, employees do not have opportunity to show their unique appearance and identity as all employees have approximately the same appearance. This might have again it's negative impact on workers' perfomance.
In conclusion, there might be some benefits to have a dress code, but most of all I see drawbacks of this policy, as it might effect on the employees' work quality negatively. I recommend that, companies should consider employees opinion as well before puting into practice dress code policy.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","There are opposite views as to which stage of life would exert the most influence on a child's life. Some people hold that the pre-school life is the most influential, while others disagree and claim that the teenage life, notably the period of staying at school, would be more important to his/her life. This essay is to evaluate both views and demonstrate my opinion.
Before entering the school, children usually receive the most influence from their parents and friends. At home, children would spend much time with their parents teaching them a variety of knowledge needed to help an adolescent act properly and get recognised by the society in the future. When staying outside, children would also be influenced by their friends or other peers since children tend to resemble the behaviours of their peers in order to integrate into the social group of adolescents.
In the school life, a child's personality would be shaped both by classmates who frequently interact with the child and potentially affect the child, and by teachers presenting knowledge in various fields of science and liberal arts so as to help the child obtain a basic understanding to the world.
As far as I am concerned, it is rather arbitrary to conclude which period of life would be more important than the other, since a child's psychological development is too complex to be understood. After all, the importance of pre-school life or teenage period might vary from one child to another. Children have their respective understandings as to which person deserves their admiration and which period of life teaches them the best lesson.

It presents not only the professional players and companies with high earnings, also gain reputations in their fields. From personal view, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. But, from professional players and companies, I think the phenomenon is a positive development.
At first, as an audience, a fan or a consumption, I have to pay more costs for watching sports events or purchasing sport commodities than before.

This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.
Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can't speak well foreign language, can't communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can't adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.
On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","To be a part of a modern society people must follow laws that are set in place by the superior authorities. Some agree that if there would be no rules, our society could not function the way it does now. This essay will argue why rules and laws are necessary for a functioning society.
Some people have such high moral standarts, that even if there would be no rules, they would act exactly as they are with rules set in place. These people are geniunely kind and would never want to cheat ir cause harm to another person. It is not the law that makes them act this way, but rather their personality and values. This is why if everyone would be like this, no laws would be necessary, because people would act humane and want only the best for eachother.
The society we live in could not exist without rules and laws set in place to control it. Everyone is different and they have a different value system and understanding of what is an acceptable action and what is not. Some people believe that it is ok to steal from another, cheat or do harm to another person. Only thing that tries to keep them in place is our system law enforcement, that promises consequences if the rules are broken. For many people this is enough to live by the rules. However, even with the laws set in place, some still break them for their own benifit. If people commit crime, knowing that they can be punished for it, how many more would do harm if there would be no consequences to their action? For these reasons our world could not run without it being regulated by the system of law.
To conclude, even though some people naturally follow rules, it is not enough for a functioning society, because many others would feel free to do what they want to.

Despite the outrageous salary that people could have, many consider that government ought to submit a limit of wages. However, others believe that is profitable for their nation.
Thinking to all poverty that there are in the world, I can understand why some individuals estimate to not allow indecent wages. In my opinion, a larger number of people who earn significant salaries always waste their money into useless luxuries to show off. However, when we can see some household which have numerous jobs to keep the wolf from the door, it seems obvious that governments should impose restrictions on income. In addition, even if individuals sometimes deserve their wages, if government had their billions which are in their bank accounts, it would help millions of inhabitants for numerous issues. It could benefit to the general interest, namely, to reduce starve, poverty or even maybe find a cure for cancer.
Nevertheless, I would say that individuals deserve their salaries because most of the time, people who earn a considerable living create employment such as Chief Executive Officer. Thanks to their ingenuity and their leadership, this small number of geniuses build corporation which give to thousands of persons a full-time job. Indeed, citizens must not forget that everyone pay taxes hence, for example, if a businessman had a heavy income, he would pay higher taxes than everybody. Furthermore, this gap between salaries could also be justified due to different level of studies or responsibility which lead to distinct income.

2,"Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion)","Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes' performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public's life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor's comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse.

2,"Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?","Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?
Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.
The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.
My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,"The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Despite the fact that physical punishment of pupils at schools is decreasing, it is considered by many that it improves discipline. This essay completely disagrees with this view because such measures are applied to those who are unable to counterattack and it maybe the easiest way but also the most inhumane.
Firstly, physical assault is usually applied by teachers against children who are not able to stop the violence. In other words, it is not highly probable that an adolescent will try to hurt a teenager who may stop the hitting or even push it back. Thus, kids are at higher risk because the only thing they are able to do in such cases is just try to run away. Moreover, children should understand that they earn what they deserve meaning that the level of repercussions should correspond to the seriousness of so called crime. For example, Sweden schools have publicly available the set of rules and non-physical measures that will be taken against the violators, that confirms that other methods are also effective to keep appropriate kids' behaviour.
Secondly, it is much more easier for many to maintain a discipline using the fear of corporal punishment. This means that it seems unnecessary and time-waste for grown-ups to try to apply other methods while a hectic kid may be calmed down just in few seconds using the fear of pain. Pupils may not be involved in a lesson and interrupt a teacher because they are not interested in the subject that may be caused by the fact that the teacher was not able to select appropriate technics to convey knowledge. For example, a research conducted by a US institution revealed that 90% of corporal punishments were applied to pupils who did not l listened to their teachers during a lesson.
In conclusion, physical violence should be discontinued in schools because mostly weak kids are in danger and they are subject for such punishments because adolescents chose the simplest way of violence and fear to better the behaviour.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

While many people believe that being the location of the events can bring tremendous advantages to the host, others argue that the preparation does not worth the benefits. This essay will examine the opinions of both sides.
To begin with, an international sport tournament leads to an abruptly economic growth as it attracts a large number of sports fans from all around the globe. Being the destination of these visitors, all hotels in the city and neighbouring areas can be fully booked and local businesses surrounding will be in turmoil to serve the tourists. For example, the Olympics usually caused all accommodations around the hosting areas to be occupied and therefore, the city can obtain additional income by setting up temporary accommodations. Nevertheless, these opportunities usually come with enormous prices.
With the foregoing benefits, the hosting country needs to put enormous effort into preparation prior to the event. To elaborate, in order to welcome a countless amount of visitors, the country is required to invest in constructing, maintenance, and improvement of venues and various relevant locations. As a certain level of readiness and handling standards are expected from the fans, failing to meet the expectations can lead to negative reputations of the country. Furthermore, the hosting country will also have to bear the risks that may impact the event. For example, if there is any force majeure such as a pandemic, the event may be postponed or even cancelled.
To conclude, the occurance of international sports events can bring significant devlopments to the host in an exchange of a great deal of investments and risks. Thus, the government must consider thoroughly before deciding to step in.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

In my opinion, I agree that crafts and physical interaction between kids are essential for their development in all aspects. Modern technology which contains computer games may have negative effects on their overall development.
The reason why I believe that such activities are important is that kids are building their personalities during the first years of their life, and this building process requires them to play and interact with their peers in real-life situations which without any doubt can not be done through online games that do not offer this rich experience to them. For example, when a child faces her friends and communicates with them face to face doing some activities, she will learn from them things that will contribute to her growth in many ways.
In addition to that reason, outdoor activities offer authentic exposure to different situations which helps children to learn how to deal and manage their actions which will increase their awareness, on the other hand, computer games can not provide the exposure that may be needed to achieve such benefits. To illustrate, children who play outside their houses with their mates generally will give a specific and quick response to different situations in contrast with those who spend hours infront of computer screens.

As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.
Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.
Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.

For instance, if children see a french fries and hamburgers advertisement in cartoons they are watching, they may want to eat fast food every day to be like their favourite cartoon character who enjoys the same meal.
On the other hand, some people are convinced that only parents are responsible for their own kids. They understand that children's food and sports habits are similar to those which their parents have. For example, if human beings explain to their kids how food influences physical and mental health and cook fresh, healthy dishes for the whole family every day, no one will want to buy fast food or even overeat.
In conclusion, the government is responsible the same as parents are. From my point of view, children's obesity is a huge problem that is difficult to solve in the modern world because of a lot of different factors. Nevertheless, if the government allows selling only healthy food in schools, and parents teach kids to do physical exercises and eat junk food only on holidays, obesity in children may have a chance to decrease with time.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,"Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","With diet and nutrition becoming more and more popular nowadays, the food industry started to attract a significant number of people to join in, students included. While young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. Personally, I strongly disagree with the latter.
The insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. First of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. In fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. For example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. Another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. However, the statistics said otherwise. In the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.
Pursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. Not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. In addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.
In conclusion, students should be encouraged to study the science and procedures of preparing food because it is a topic just as important as any other subjects.",7.0,6.5,"Scores: 7, 6"

A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals.

2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"As we are living into a monetary society, it's unavoidable for people to discuss about money matters in daily conversation about housing mortgage, salaries and other living expenses. The financial anxiety has become a main source of headache that lingers on especially for the young generation who has to bear the increasing burden of a city life. From a standpoint of a college student, I believe it's not a postive development that should have occurred in our modern society.
When our conversation turns to money issues, it doesn's really help up with our status quo, but only further exacerbates social anxiety by unnecessay comparison and higher expectation. I personally have similar experiences when friends start to talk about their monthly pocket money and daily luxuries they prefer. We are widely variated in family background, social classes and opportunities. If our daily social discourses are always filled with monetary issues, it is only widening the social gaps between different groups of people and making our society a place less inclusive for underprevilaged people.
Additionally, money-oriented conversations might as well shape our world perspective into a very pratical, highly self-interested and boring one, which is full of daily trifles and calculation. In book The Little Prince, he says adult will only appreciate a house when you tell them that it is worth a million pounds. It exactly depicts the moderntime conversations that value things more a monetary basis. But the problem we cannot perch on the path of money and many of our lifelong persuit doesn't rely sorely on our income and expensive services and luxaries. We are neither willing nor prepared to see a world where romance can be purchased, friendship ca be transacted and even life itself has a certain value that can be measured in dollars.
So I would really like to call on more people to rid money discussions our of their daily chats and share more about what's interesting in their seemingly mundane lives, some recent photos of an outing, newly met friends and others.

2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is becoming a trend now that husbands and wives should handle the household works together since both members of the family are working full time. In my opinion, it is convincing that the house tasks should be equally spread between both genders for the following reasons.
In many developing countries, people are required to work more than before; as a result, both genders are having busy lives nowadays and cannot handle the works of the house by only one of them. If the chores are being handled by both men and women, it increases the other partner's satisfaction and shows responsibilty. For instance, if a wife has several tasks in the kitchen to finish before heading to work and her husband helped their children to get ready for school, this emotionally affects the wife and she will eventually feel gratification.
Secondly, as technology evolves, people are having a hard time to manage the tasks of their homes and might eventually hire a nanny to take care of the children and home. As a result, children would feel loneliness in addition to being ignored by their parents. Although it is not easy to manage the work life and family at the same time, giving priority to one before the other can be counter-productive. Finally, as both partners work together to handle household work, it will eventually lead to a balanced life, their daily schedules will be organised; moreover, they will have more time to spend with their children thus, the home will not have problems as long as the mother and the father are working together to manage their home.
By way of conclusion, I would like to re-affirm there is a vital role for both males and females in order to keep their homes well balanced. Despite having a full employement job for both of them, it is necessary to share the works of their home together.",7.0,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"
2,"In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?","In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people's perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered.

Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.
In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.
For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,
it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.
Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.
However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.
In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.
Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.

In the last century there is an opposite trend, which leads to bans on any physical punishment. I believe any corporal punishment should be against the law in schools and any other facilities.
Recent studies show, that violence is neither most effective nor useful method in education. According to the scientists, any type of physical punishment creates a negative psycological pattern. Students focus on fear and put extra effort into learning things by hard. But students don't use this knowledge or keep it after upcomming test or exam.
Besides, these methods harm students and reduce creativity in the future. Scientists say, that physically abused kids develop psycological disorders in the future life. This leads to an increased suicide rate, higher chance of depression, and lower happiness.
Most importantly, physical punishment doesn't address the core of the problem. There are several reasons for a low school performance: a low interest in the topic, a bad explanation, or a low quality of life. To increase students performance we have to focus on quality of education first. But there are some good news. Humanity made a huge progress since internet and youtube are much more accessable nowdays.
In general, there is not a single piece of evidence which support physical punishment. It's a method from the past that should not be used nowdays.

I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.
It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.
On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.

There is a debate conserning the activities that should be porsued during the free time. There are people who think that it is important to enrich mind with cultural activities such as reading books and doing word puzzles. On the other hand, there are those who suggest that leisure time is made to relax the mind. I believe that a balance between the two extreme views is the better solution.
It is very important to give to coltivate our mind with culture. Reading a book, listen to classical musing, play games in which problem solving tricks should be sold is a funny way to spend your time and at the same time exercise the brain. To spend 15 minutes playing a game in which you have to solve math problems or doing world puzzles can be considered as the mental counterpart of the physical workout. To read a book had always been considered as the best way to learn without studying. Another interesting way in which the brain should be trained is by playing an instruments. To focus on some activities that will encourage the development of your skills and more stimuli on your brain is surely one of the best way to spend a part of your leisure time.
On the other hand, it is also important to rest. Also your brain need a break. While it is easy to rest your body by sitting on the sofa it is not equally easy to stop your brain and to give to it a break. Listening to classical music, listening to the sounds of the nature, to have a nice walk, do meditations are some ways in which you can rest your mind. Even if it will be time in which the brain is on pause, some positive effect will be noted. Indeed, after only 30 minutues the brain will be recharged and full of energy.
In conclusion, I believe that a balance between intellectual activities and total rest of the brain will be the best solution to give to the mind both stimuli and time to recharge itself.

In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.
Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.
Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.
As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.

Although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences, I disagree the news should be reported continuously.
To begin with, some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children. Children tend to be susceptible to any information, including enjoyable news, and heavy crime news. Therefore, some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news, such as entertainment, sports, and technological innovation news.
On the other hand, some crimes, including violence, and murder cases should
not diminish the volume of news. Recently, the Japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene. In addition, reporters, and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report, or detail in letters. This news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes. For example, parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time. In addition, the parents can observe where the children are 24/7 by taking advantage of GPS.
Finally, Japan is one of the safest countries across the globe. Therefore, Japanese people tend to overrate the Japanese society that crimes, including violence, will never happen to our life. In contrast, looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered, and avoid kidnapping by criminals.

Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn't a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country.

In fact, they believe that homework is a crucial part for the pupil education.
Personally speaking, I am convinced that homework are positive tools for scholar to remember and pratice what they have learnt in class, but it should be a small ratio rather than what they are currently asking.
From my personal experience, I learnt that at the school age, children do not comprehend the importance of aknolwedge information in each different courses. As a result of it, pupil only focus on what they like, discarting subjects that are not in their taste and this is when homework plays a fundamental part. It helps scholar to fix in their memories the lesson they attended and from there building more ideas about it. Consequently, following the next courses will be easier for them. Not only does it help them to learn what has been thought, but also it gives them a method of study and habits which will be crucial for university or personal aknwoledgement. It set up the base to thrive on their own in the future.
Having said that, it is understandable if some people are against homework. Teachers might be given a heavy homework load to students, which is unfair because the children should also have the time to enjoy their childhood, playing and having fun. On the other hand, saying no to homework in their full is incorrect. If scholar are not having any homework, they will lose opportunity to learn and in the long run it will affect their productivities.

On the other hand, others believe we are the resposible for the distruction of certain natural environment. I believe the disadvantages could exceed the advantages.
Nowadays, thanks to the techonolical development, we have the great possibility to go anywhere and visit extraordinary places like the South Pole.

Although the workers of turistm sector claim to pay attention in preserving the natural status of places like the South Pole, it is impossibile to believe in them. Indeed, to welcome people and technological instruments is already a way in which a natural enviroment is stressed and ruined. In particular, techonological advices produce radiations, which toghether with chimical and electrical stimuli could afftect the ground of a place like the South Pole. For instance, radiations and electrical stimulations can make the temperature higher and this could be a cause of the environment's ruination. Furthermore, animals who live in the South Pole can be negatively influenced by the turists. Indeed, they are not social animals who have grown up together with human beings. They could get sick because of the noisy sounds produced by humans and by their techonolical advices.

In my opinion, the government should not interfere with this topic and, consequently, gay marriage should be legally allowed.
Nowadays, being a omosexual couple is difficult because the society does not recognise them the same rights of an eterosexual couple, such as the possibility to adopt children or to share goods. As human beings, gay women and men should have the same opportunities and rights of every other people. Hence, they should be allowed to legally marry and live their life as a normal one.
Furthermore, I think that gay couples do not affect the wellness of the society in any way. Indeed, even if people believe that the only possible family is the traditional one, it is not true and other kind of family does exist. Many children grow up by people of the same sex and this does not affect their education or influence their thought. For that reason, different type of family should be recognised.

Having children at home and be their teacher is not easy. Although, it may be important for their development. A good side of home schooling, is the chance to be more connected with your own family and being able to manage your own time without having strict schedule. This means that you don't only have to study the subjects that are for example taught in school, but also it gives the children a chance to invest their time in activities in which they are interested in.
On the other hand, sending kids to school gives them the chance to interact more with other people and develop social skills. They have more opportunities to create connections and interactions with other students with the same age and also it might be considered more helpful to be in the same situation with others, so that they can learn to help each other.

2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people believe that educational facilities must accept the same numbers of men as women in every subject. There are both pros and cons in this argument, which will be discussed in this essay.
A tremendous number of people think that equality is crucial for education. Nowadays, more and more activists fight for women's rights. They want that every female can study everything that she prefers, notwithstanding this is socially acceptable or not. Moreover, many feminists suggest that patriarchal societies do not allow women to study equality with men. For example, when a little boy says to his younger sister that she is not intelligent enough for the men's play, a little girl grows up and thinks that she cannot study men's subjects and work men's jobs. Therefore, the main reason to accept equal numbers of both sexes is to crush many stereotypes about women's intellectual abilities and allow them to choose which subject they really want to study.
On the other hand, some people can complain that this is discrimination against men. For instance, if every university will accept only 50% of men with the highest grades in every subject, men with average grades but higher than women's will not be accepted. Furthermore, this idea does not guarantee that all wise women will study in universities. Females also can do not want to learn every existing subject.
In conclusion, the main point of equality in education is about choice, not coercion. From my point of view, that would be great if male and female students could study the same subjects; if more boys prefer to be teachers, while more girls like to be scientists. However, this is impossible when a lot of stereotypes exist, and the coercion of universities to accept balanced numbers of students based on their genders does not help solve the global issue with equality.",7.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree),"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child's personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer's ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph.

What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.
On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.
On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.

Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is undoubtedly the case that the world has become a global village nowadays. Cooperations between different countries exist almost on every occasion. As a result, there are inevitably large amounts of information that are exchanged and shared for various usages. However, access to information has remained to be one of the most debatable issues. Some people believe that information should be shared without restriction, while others insist that the foremost information shouldn't be exchanged for free. In my view, appropriate measures or costs can be taken to protect valuable information from being abused or stolen.
It is fairly easy to understand the view of people who are in favor of exchanging information as much as possible. To improve the quality of research or guarantee the success of cooperation, it is usually necessary to share resources and exchange minds with each other. Furthermore, the amount of shared information is often decisive to the time and result, which sometimes might be eagerly expected. For example, it is almost unimaginable that the vaccine of covid 19 was so quickly created without intensive international cooperation, which contains an enormous sum of shared knowledge and experience in the diverse field, from governments to universities. With the benefit of this sharing, the period of the vaccine, which can take more than ten years in the past, was immensely shortened this time and the quality of the vaccine is also prestigious over the world.
Nevertheless, the over-sharing of information could also be harmful and risky. There is every possibility that information of importance and value can be misused and eventually leads to severe problems if the intention of usage can't be proven as legal and righteous or the risk of information leakage exists through sharing. For example, if classified military information is hacked by terrorists while the governments of two countries are sharing and discussing their military intelligence, it will result in a horrible disaster that treats all the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect the safety of sensitive information from unauthorized access.
To sum up, sharing information is certainly helpful and meaningful in improving a wide variety of cooperation. However, it is also urgent to pay attention to the sharing of sensitive information in order to guarantee its safety.",7.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

It is widely accepted that young people should travel or work for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies. From a personal perspective, the benefits are more significant than the drawbacks for young people who decide to have a gap year.
On the one hand, most students who just completed high school education have stressful periods and lots of plans that want to do. Young people could feel disoriented which means they need time for finding what they want. There are a lot of youths who put themselves under pressure thus, they get more and more stress in their study and work and can get some mental illness.

On the second hand, there are some negative points of a gap year for the youths. The young people who decide to have a free year will face late completing university studies which may lead to having fewer opportunities than their peers deciding to start university immediately. On some occasions, it is difficult for young people who do not have any experience to find internship jobs. Thus, they may waste lots of time without any achievement.

Some people believed that these have an effect on young people. The advantages on young people when working or traveling before entering college are saving money and making funds which can be used for matriculation, and they can have enough time for mental break which foster mental health that will help them more prepared individual as student. While the disadvantages are waste of money when traveling and delayed finishing studies when working.
Moreover, when deciding to take an educational break for travel or work between finishing high school and entering in college has advantages. First would be making funds for enrollment fees and saving money for allowance. Young people can have the opportunity to support themselves in their studies instead of asking financial support from parents. By this way, they become more independent because they can provide their daily necessities. Second would be achieving healthy mental health through traveling abroad. For some students, high school is stressful just like college especially when they are too serious in studying. Going abroad for a vacation might help to destress the students at the same time giving self a time for relaxation which is essential to the mind and body.
However, this decision also brings disadvantages to young people like wasting of money or savings from parents when traveling abroad. Instead of saving this money for college, it is used for booking a trip, hotel accommodation, and other recreational activities.

There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.
And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.
If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.

As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.
The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.

2,"The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays population of the cities have grown bigger than in the countryside. I will write about my thought of the cause of the movement from the countryside into the cities, and if there is a possibility to reverse this event, what it will be.
First, I think the cause of the movement is partly because of the difference of the convenience, and the work types you can get between in the countrysides, and in the cities. Personally I do prefer to live in the countrysides, but I can't bare if there are none or slow internet connections there. Also I think the varieties of the jobs you can get are quite different in each location. For example, when I went to Australia to get jobs, of course people tend to stay in the cities so that they can get easy, fancy city jobs like waiter/waitress, shop retail, jobs related with news papers and so on. However the number of jobs are limited. I really wanted to stay in the city, but the amount of money you get was not quite enough to pay rent, and holiday fee, so I moved into the countrysides which had varieties of farm jobs. Sure there were easy jobs like in the cities, but the number of shops, and restaurants are quite small, and they were hiring mostly local people rather than working holiday workers. There I got a farm hand job in the tomato field. It was really hard job. We needed to work from 7 am when the sun rises to 6 pm when the sun sets. It was hard for my poor body, too. That is why I think most people move to the cities rather than stay in the countrysides.
Although I am not sure if there is a possibility to reverse this event, I think there are quite a lot of good experience you can only get in the countrysides. One thing I can say is the people and the living pace are slower, and more relaxed in countrysides than in the cities. For example like I myself said, I prefer living in the countrysides than in the cities. In fact I moved to Edmonton in Canada, which is a city, but I'd say more like a town, but a lot more relaxed than Tokyo where I used to live. Sometimes people living in the crazy fast cities like Tokyo, New York, and etc actually want to slow down the pace to more relaxing cities, or countrysides. If we want to reverse this movement, I think you need to advertise what benefits you can get in the countrysides. For example, they have quite magnificent views, good benefits to raise your kids, and so on. I think it can really reverse the movement because nowadays people are so interested in the educations of their kids, so scientifically we need to prove that living in the countrysides, and raising the children can be really beneficial for them. I myself have 2 children, and I can feel the benefits of living in the countrysides. The more free time they have, the more creative they become, and I strongly believe the more creative they are, the more happier they can lead their lives.
As a result, I believe that we can reverse, or slow down the speed of the movement of the people from the countrysides into the cities if we empharsise the benefits of raising kids in the countrysides more.",7.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.
To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.
Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.
All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.",7.5,7.5,"Scores: 7, 8"
2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","Recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. There are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.
In terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. Firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. Besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. If you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. So, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.
However, science does play an extremely important role in our society. If not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. Science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. A good example can be seen in the United States, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the Microsoft and Artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. In contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.

While there are clear drawbacks to this, in my opinion the advantages are more significant. The essay will demonstrate that pupils will build life skills by joining the program. This is followed by explaining why continuing learning in the domestic school after finishing the exchange can be practicable.
It is obvious that the exchange program is likely to give an opportunity for students to learn to live with people from different society and nationality which is the experience that they are not able to have when studying in their country. As a result, they will have the ability to communicate with various types of people and handle challenging situations. Furthermore, there is research indicating that pupils who study in another country are able to lead a group of acquaintances under pressure.
On the other hand, those who oppose this may point out that when the exchange complete and the students resume their courses in the domestic school, they are perhaps unable to keep pace with others and, consequently, there might be some students who cannot pass exams. Nevertheless, the aforementioned issue can possibly be addressed by teachers to arrange extra classes for the students in order for them to learn about what they have missed when they attended the exchange program.
In conclusion, despite the fact that some students may find difficulty in carrying on studies in the school after the completion of the exchange, I am convinced that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.

2,Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called 'work experience placements'. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can't see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won't really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child's entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week's work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of 'holiday' away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives.

As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some people believe that the science of food and how to make meals should be introduced in schools while others argue that schools should offer only important subjects. I believe that the science of food and how to prepare it should be part of the school subjects as it can bring several benefits in student's lives. Thus, this essay discusses how creating an understanding of good nutrition, health and well-being it's important for students to support positive learning and development.
Modern society with the advertisement of fast food and new products rich in sugar is addressing children and teenagers to choose junk food over healthy. Thus, it is important for schools to introduce the science of food into their curriculum. This subject can positively influence the students' choices about nutrition creating knowledge about food categories, compositions and nutritional values. For example, promoting a healthy and balanced diet can support the students to establish the mindset of acknowledging what they are introducing in their bodies and consequently finding specific foods that might positively impact their well-being.
Contrarily, there's the belief that such a subject will reduce the time available for more didactical learning like math, geography or literacy. It might be true as not everyone could be interested in learning about food. However, if observing in detail the science of food, it is evident that it involves a series of challenging topics such as chemistry, biology, food engineering and microbiology.
To sum up, while some people think that introducing the science of food could be detrimental to students' learning as it would reduce the time available for more didactical subjects, on the other hand, learning about food and its composition, can be beneficial as it provides with the knowledge that can support healthy eating and wellbeing.",7.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,"Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays people are tend to take risk in their lifestyle, where people live only a short lifespan. Humans in the world, in the present day do many paramount activities which are breathtaking, changing from hang-gliding to mountain climibing. In my opinion I think this is a good change for peoples lifes, under two considerable reasons, such as people get more life experiences in nature and for their physical fitness. In this essay I will ounline my opinion and provide reasons with valid examples.
On the one hand, human begins are under the pressure of globalisation, which leads them to get more trendy experiences from nature. Since younger generation is working towards the urban development of the world they are living in large cities full of pollution and high rising buildings. When ever they find enough spare time youngsters are trying to enjoy their lifes by climbing mountains which is hiking from the technical term. To contrast this gives them the opportunity to learn more about the outside world of cities, get more experience in mother nature. They develop their knowledge about the surroundings, such as the animals, birds and different flora and faunas. As an example one of my friends wanted to do the activity of flying which this is an human made activity, but after few findings through the internet and she seeing pictures how people enjoy hiking she decided to go on a trip to Mount Everest for climbing.
On the other hand, people, or the young generation have the sense that activity of flying apparatus are outdated and this is not providing then enough physical fitness to burn their calories. Due to these reasons some group of young as well as old people climb mountains to develop their well-being, mostly people such as athletes and humans who are having various diseases such as obesity, adore to do hiking.
To sum up, in my opinion this trend is not a bad idea for the poeple to get escaped from their busy lifestyles to enjoy the nature as well as develop their fitness rather than going to artificial equipment based buildings. In fact, every sport has their own risk, so people need to accept and beware of these risky issues and attend these activities.",7.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"

2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.
International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.
It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.
In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.",7.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"In some countries, including Japan, people tend to spend long hours at work. In recent years, this issue is often discussed around Japan. Although some Japanese people take it positively, I strongly oppose this idea and believe it is no longer positive development now. I would like to state some reasons with some examples in Japanese society.
Firstly, the Japanese economy used to be the worst poverty country around the world after world war two. Many buildings and companies were devastated, therefore, Japanese people stucked together on how to recover the damage and improve their economy. As a result, the Japanese economy has drastically and steadily developed. As a result, the Japanese economy was about to be the wealthiest country by 1980. In these periods from 1950 to 1990, the longer people work, the more money returned to employees. In addition, it was traditionally believed for Japanese people that it is virtue to work long hours in Japanese society.
But the economic bubble suddenly exploded in 1992, Japanese economy suddenly declined and economic growth still remains the same in 2022. Sadly, working long hours is not necessarily connected to companies profit. Although it is because of economic recession, companies still believed that it is important to work hours will result in increase company's profit. As a result, some people became workaholics and the number of people who are suffering from mental depression. Currently, Japan is one of the highest suicide rates in developed countries.
Finally, in my opinion, the most important point is how productive systems companies and organizations need to create. For example, many companies tend to rely on too much tasks for employees who have better skills or positions than other employees. Therefore, they need to provide some curriculums about specific skills in IT, language, and accountant. If each employee upskilled their ability, it would be able to divide and conquer the tasks more efficiently. In addition, it must be more effective to adopt intern-ship work opportunities for university students. This means that those who already have work experience beforehand will cause to reduce their training time.
In conclusion, Japanese society is suffering from depopulation, too. This means that Japanese people are required to work with less volume workforce. Therefore, companies and the government need to consider how to work efficiently and reduce too much tasks in one employee. I believe Japanese people will be able to resolve this problem, because they are so diligent and made many success to make a countermeasure by a long history.",6.5,5.5,"Scores: 5, 6"

There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government's involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words. A wide range of vocabulary is used, including less common words such as ""degradation"",""inhospitable"", ""habitat"", ""awareness"" and ""sacred"".

Some people think there is not so much to learn about food, but I think that is wrong. There are lots of different way of preparing food, and it takes lots of time to master them. Also, science behind food is very complex, but it is significant in our life. I will demonstrate my opinion in detail in this essay.
First of all, food is a critical part of a life. In many culture, having and preparing food is considered one of the most important activities to live a enjoyable life. By having a delicious food, one can feel happiness uncomparable to anything. Moreover, preparing food for someone like family or lover is a tremendously rewarding activity. By preparing food for them, you can show how much you care about them, and share your emotions with them. To enjoy this amazing part of life, it is very important to learn how to prepare food and what makes delicious food.
Secondly, It is crucial to know about how the food effect their health. Some people say 'A human body is a sum of what they have eaten in their life', because The food they ate become a part of their body in the end. We get most of nutritions we need from food. Thus, how we eat massively affect our health. It is scientifically proven that the food culture of a country significantly effect the health status of the people. Therfore, knowing about how the nutritions in food affect our body is very important to leave a healthy life.
For this reason, it is crucial to teach about food to students in schools. Food can be a means of communication sometimes, and it can be a precious present that is given to a life. Moreover, food is a source of energy that sustain us, and sometimes it is a medicine that cure our body. Hence, students should study about how to prepare a good food, and understand how it can affect us by its nutritions.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

But, overusage of car from people can lead to air pollution and destruction to the environment as greenhouse gases are produced, which are harmful to our body. To solve this problem, many countries are encouraging people to use electronic car or campaigning to use bus or train when they commute.
2 weeks ago, I saw an environmental documentary from the television and I heard the cause of air pollution. There were many factors that could effect the air pollution, but one of the factors was the usage of the car. When we ride a car, the car produces harmful chemical gases such as carbon dioxide that lead to foggy weather. If we inhale this gases often, our lungs will become unhealthy and in worst case, lead to death. Therefore, over-reliance on cars will increase the number of people with lung disease as they produce bad chemicals.
To prevent production of harmful chemicals from the car, many people have to use bus or train for transportation rather than their private car, so government have to do campaign to use them and make festival to persuade people to use public transport. This will help the environment to reduce greenhouse gases and people to inhale more fresh air than before.
In conclusion, many people prefer to ride the private car as it is more comfortable, however, the consequences of usage of car are harmful to the environment and people's health, therefore government should educate or persuade people to use public transports instead of riding a car.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Some people argue that, they both can not go well each other on side and I completely agree with statement. In this essay, i will explain how technology affects a culture in a bad way.
Firstly, media has played important part in damaging to cultures in the world. Next to that, modern technology has more advancement in telecommunication department that turned the world into global village. Furthermore, whatever is available in one corner of the world can easily found in another one , so that, it is damaging the uniqueness of any area. People more prefer to eat western food compare to traditional hence, country's street market has also need to change in their favours and cuisine. More and more people in Asian countries, for example, are copying the styles of American outfits and street foods in India are widely replaced by KFC and Mcdonalds. Hence, media play a crucial role in culture to become less distinctive.
On controversy, while development in technology makes people life easier, it also changed the way we live. The introduction of new appliances like the microwave and electric grill has radically changed the traditional cooking. People no longer spend time in kitchen to make food for themselves as they were used to do before. In addition, development in travel and tourism can much affordable to travel in other countries and one can be easily explored the world by advance facilities. Everytime, when a tourist visits a country, they bring with it own culture and it leaves some impression on the local people. For example, a great number of people in India started wearing jeans after the development of tourist attraction in the area. Hence, the link between the evolution of technology and culture damage can be seen.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, a topic often discussed is the education and its relation with the difference in people's ability and possibilities. According to some, it should be better to separate students based on their academic skills, while others believe that a valid education can be transmitted without discriminating people based on their ability.
People that support the separation of students believe that an omogeneous group can learn better and faster. Indeed, if someone has less skills compared to the others component of the group, teachers have two possibilities. First, to lower the level of the lessons in order to allow a catch up. Second, leave behind the student wiht low ability. Both solutions are not optimals. Thus, if we put together students with similar capabilities, we can make the process of learing more efficent for both groups.
The other vision is to educate students all together. By doing so, you can encourage low skills students to engage theirselves to catch up with the most brilliant one. Moreover, if you split the group, students with less capabilities can develop self-estimation problems and so, they will think that they can not be in the ""best"" group. Another good point for educate all students together is that people with higher ability will help their classmates. However, the level of the class will be probably lower.
To conclude, I think that the best solution depends on the purpose of the educator and on the age of students. Indeed, it is very differet the education of children or teenagers. For example, if you want to create the future class of engineers, you should divide students based on their academic ability.

I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.
The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banks
and even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.
For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.

This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.",9.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

In my opinion, some of the causes might be the transition from agricultural to technological economies and the lack of support from governments to coutryside economy. I will suggest that major support and promotion of the agricultural services might encourage people to stay at coutryside.
The national migration is a well-know fact that happen into the countries as a product of technological advancements and its impact in the national and international economy. The service sector is nowadays the main activity within the countries, which resulted in more opportunities along the the cities of the world because this sector is mainly located in cosmopolitan areas, therefore, rural people have decided to emigrate to the cities seeking to improve their standard of living. Additionally, with the growth of the service sector, governments have reduced the funding for countryside which resulted in high rates of unemployed people in that regions. This lack of support, encourage the movement of people as a negative side effects in the cities because of overcowded populations.
In order to mitigate the overcrowded populations accross the cities in the world, it is crucial to support and promote the country side economies to avoid the movement of people domestically. Governmments need to increase the budged allocated to rural areas, but additionally, they ought to provide better systems to promote and increase the participation of agricultural economies. If farmers find the adecuate support to produce the farms, they are less unlikely to abandond their lands because they already have a livelyhood. This support may impact benefically in cities because differents social issues could be reduced.
In conclusion, it is an undeniable fact that the domestic migration happens because of technological advancements and lack of support to countryside economy.

For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families' ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher's comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered.

To exemplify, Dubai is famous for its different architectural buildings, such as Burj Khalifa, the tallest building globally, the Dubai frame, and many more.
Although it looks nice and pleasant for us to see the city with new buildings, the construction industry should abide by the law while constructing.

However, some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers. Personally, I think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.
It is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. If we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. For instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. However, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. At this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.
Some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. However, in my opinion, I think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. For one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. Thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. For another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. At last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.

Experiencing failure and win will teach the offspring how to encourage their peers when they feel demotivated in order to reach a mutual goal, also how to share and demonstrate their appreciation in terms of winning a comptetion. I have obsorved my little brother when he plays in groups, noticeablly, he gets more motivated and happier when he wins alongside his team because he can express his gratitude and show sence of appreciation to his peers wich means he now developed coopreation skills.
In conclusion, despite the fact that involving in teamwork kind of activity will yield the advancement regarding cooperation and cognitive skills for youngesters, also encountering the results of a competition, whether it was failure or winning, will inevitably make them acuire skills to deal with such events that evenually make them better cooperatives.",5.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?
Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).
Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.
On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.
Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.",8.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

However, which between individual or team is most useful and salutary is a question that stir up fierce debate amongst public opinion.
To start with, beginning a team sport activity since from the childhood has countless advantages, first of all, it helps connecting athletes one another in an engaging and ever- stimulating experience.
Secondly, by empowering players of sharing tasks with the team, both empathy and discipline will be developed.

South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make.

Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.
Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.

2,Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In the recent years, new companies are born and increase their competitive stregth in terms of employment more than ever. In response to the fast-evolving business industry, white-colared people may need an extra motivation than just having their profile featured with a big company. To my firm believe, the practice of encouraging employess through incentives or bonus is an effective way of maintaining the quality of work as well as another way to show appreciation to the seniors.
To my knowledge, this stlyle of management has been practicing for more than a decade, from small to large enterprises. The development of target acheivement or goal getter tactic is no surprise. We cannot deny the fact that money plays the most important part of cycling the world's economic and, of course, our everyday life. Hence, the most effective and easiest way to get people' hand on work is no where around but an extra sum of incentives or bonus from the company's annual benefits.
This hit hard to my personal experience. I realised the essence of it when I worked in a telesale company. I was offered a relatively medium-to-low basic salary which could not even yeild me any allowance after living cost reduction. However, I was fortunate enough to have a monthly incentive which would be evaluated solely on my performance each month. The evaluation was fair to the extent that I feel appreciated for what I work for.
On the contrary, if there were not given any incentives and were offered with something else as a reward, i.g. a free trip to somewhere, a couple of coupon vouchers, or even a car or house, I would still be ungrateful compared with the extra money earned every month. The reason is simply because stable income is considered more reliable than any other tangible or intagible assets, in the perspective of an employee. On top of that, the incentives and bonus can be increased yearly or quaterly based on the company performance.
In summary, I would like to reiterate that I agree on rewarding the emplyees with incentives and bonuses. Due to the fact that they can be as tool to build a strong montivation among the employees and deliver the company's gratitude toward them in an appropriate way.",5.0,5.5,"Scores: 6, 5"

This essay will discuss the reason that people are wasting food and suggest a viable solution.
The principal reason is that people are unable to finish their dishes as they often take more portions of food than they can, which can cause more food to be wasted. For instance, buffets are the most common place that wastes tons of food, especially in hotels. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.

For instance, buffets are the most commonly wasted tons of food, especially in the hotel. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.
A solution to this worrying problem is to take away the leftovers back home. As food can be kept for a few days in the refrigerator, people can cook it at their house without going out to afford meals. As a result, this can reduce the expenditure on food and transportation. In my experience, my mother would pack the leftover food and bring it back home. As a result, the food still tastes the same at the restaurant. Thus, my family and I will never discuss what to eat for the rest of the day. Had it not been for preventing food waste by bringing it back home, the amount of waste foods would never have been able to reduce.
In conclusion, one of the main problems with the over-wasting of food in many countries is unable to finish the food and this can be solved by taking away the food back home. It is predicted that more and more individuals will be taking away their remaining food to their accommodation and this will reduce the amount of waste food.",6.0,5.5,"Scores: 6, 5"
2,"In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","As the '70s of the last century started, the world lived a social revolution that led to a change in the family structure and in family roles' conception.
I believe these changes are positive and take people to be more inclusive towards all forms of love: heterosexual and homosexual. The social revolution permitted also women to impose their role in the workplace as leaders and not just in the house as mothers.
In the last decades a revolution concerning the concept of family led to conceive the couple and not just the married heterosexual couple with at least a child as complete and valued families. This social step is crucial since before that people who loved a person of the same sex as well as women who decided to have no child were treated by society as the maker of the family collapse. In Sicily, for instance, where there is still a lot of work to be done in this respect, it was almost crazy to define a group of people composed of a woman and a man with a son born outside marriage to fall under the concept of family. Therefore, I believe that this social change is taking people to believe step by step that all forms of love must be respected and most crucially they are starting to understand the concept of family as the non-physical place in which love lives.
The role of women in the workplace and in the house radically changed in the same years. The revolution concerned both the conception of women as free independent workers who obtain leadership positions as well as the conception of women as wifes and mothers. Indeed, women are no anymore required to live their life trying to make the house perfectly clean, satisfy the husband's desires and grow up the children. At the same time, husbands discover again their role as fathers and not just as money-maker of the house. Thus thanks to social change women can dedicate time to themself to their passions and give importance not just to their role as mothers but also to their role in the workplace as leaders.
In conclusion, I believe the social change that characterised the last decades produced positive changes that permitted us to obtain a new understanding of the conception of family and love and to evaluate the role of women in the house and outside as free and independent workers.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.
Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.
The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.

In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.
It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens.

Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country.

2,Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recently, there have been several laws to control the noise made by neighbors and surrounded places close to people's accommodations. Some people think that these laws should be strict and effectively enforced by authorities in order to avoid any small noise that might disturb the private comfortability. Others believe that such laws might entail a few disadvantages and negative repercussions on people's lives. In this essay I will be trying to count possible advantages and disadvantages of this legislation.
It is well known that home is the ideal place to rest, relax and bring positive energies to the residents. Thus, noise made by the neighbors might threat these unique blessings we are used to enjoying in our houses. Moreover, many people perform vital actions within their homes that require silence and high concentration, such as studying, reading and other forms of creative activities. Therefore, governments' duty is to guarantee that these activities are performed without any disturbance, by making specific laws to control the amount of noise and ensure optimal quality of life for all the citizens. In addition, if there were not laws to control the noise, we would encounter many more fights and inconvenient incidents among neighbors.
On the other hand, there is another aspect to be considered. Calling for strict laws and total preventing of any sounds produced by adjacent people could sounds unacceptable. People still have the basic right to arrange meetings and parties at their homes, and others need to listen to music as a vital action for their soul and wellbeing.
To conclude, in order to find the balance between the advantages and the disadvantages, governments might design flexible laws to meet the people's needs. For example, in some cities, noise preventing is valid only in specific periods of the day, periods in which most of the people supposed to rest and need silence.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

In addition, the fast technology evolution in the present came from the concerns of many scientists around the world. Some people believe that focusing on the space evolution matter. While others argue that they should invest inside the country. In my opinion, the exploration of our planet could enhance people's lives in many different ways. However, the human organization should do the best in other more useful sectors to improve human needs.
On one hand, the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years. Scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. For example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually. In other words, exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it.
On the other hand, the benefit of universe exploration may change our earth's environment and improve our lives for the next coming generation in technology. For instance, people after the year 2000 had better communication with each other which was not even possible at any time ever. Moreover, the government invests to develop space exploration companies.
In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view I strongly believe that space companies such as SpaceX must try to find a new resources to visit other planets.

2,« Previous,"Nowadays celebrities earn more money than politicians. What are the reasons for this? Is it a positive or negative development?Sample EssayNowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative development.There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money, such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizens' loyalty to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems.In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional.

2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.
The first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.
Consequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.
To sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine.",8.5,7.5,"Scores: 8, 7"
2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?","In today's era, most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities. However, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. In my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.
Due to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. An average adult has to pay more than 70,000 USD yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. The job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. Some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.
On the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. In recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. For example, in India, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.
In my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses. Furthermore, better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students.
In conclusion, favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government, as well as lower tution fees for university attendees.",9.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.",6.0,4.5,"Scores: 5, 4"

Although it has been declined, some argue that it should be used to exceel the conduct. I personally disagree with this notion because physical punishment compromise the mental and physical well-being of students.
It is well-established that in the modern times educational procedures have changed hugely compared with previous decades. For instance, psychologists were not part of the school staff before the modern times. Today pupils behaviour is analysed throughout systems and complex theories in order to understand their apptitudes before to produce judgements and punishments. When in the past students were drastically hitting by educators, it repercuted in negative consequences because physical and mental traumas resulted as a product of this practice. Some pupils developed violent behaviours and others suffered from lack of confidence and self-harmed, even some of them commited suicide.
Despite the negative evidence of corporal punishment on students, the education system implemented new methods and modalities to maintain the students bahaviour. First of all, the physical punishment was entire banned from schools, even, teachers might face legal meassures if they impart this kind of punishment. Secondly, psychologists play an important role in schools today because they are able to understand the social environment of students, thus, they know what mechanisms use to improve their behaviour. For instance, these professionals are capable to use a bunch of principles, values and speechs that are scientifically proved leaving the physical punishment behind in the history.
To conclude, corporal punishment was used in the past to control students behaviour, nowadays it has been drastically reduced Nonetheless some claim that it should be used again to improve conducts. I strongly disagree with this statement because it is proved that this practice caused negative impacts in students life, furthermore, new professions and methods are implemented which have demostrated high rates of efficacy to pursuade and improve the well-behaviour in students.",6.0,5.5,"Scores: 5, 6"

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.
On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.
On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.
In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.",5.5,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","In recent years there has been a great deal of discussion about where it is better to shop. A number of people are of the opinion that it is preferable to choose an online shopping according to some modernisations in technology, while others contend that the traditional type of buying things is more effective. In this essay, I shall examine both sides before offering my own thoughts in the subject.
To begin with, buying things online can be much easier compared to conventional type of shopping due to the number of reasons. First of all, almost all people in our world have a connection to the internet where you can find whatever you want, starting from analyzing crucial information, ending with buying products online. The first reason is the fact that you can find a great amount of websites prepared for shopping. These websites have clothes, products, technics and other stuff you need. For instance, people can buy fruits and/or vegetables from other countries, so, it means that they can discover culture of people living there.
As for traditional shopping, it is time-consuming because you need to drive or go around the town looking for things you need. In fact, people who choose conventional type of shopping need a great time of preparation to go there because they need to look good, especially if they are the governor ones or even another important people in area they live.
In conclusion, every person has to choose his own preferable type of shopping because evryone has different opinions. Also, if there were no online shopping, people would have less things the want to buy.",6.0,5.5,"Scores: 6, 5"

Both ones are important in teaching life skills. Below, we will see which one of them is a great way of teaching more important life skills.
First of all, we need to understand that doing activities in group, or as a team can help us deepen our knowlodge, because they provide us with the ability to share ideas and learn from each other which is something crucial in our daily lives as human being as we were all created to live together as communities. In addition, group or team activities will not only allow us to know the other person living next us but to figure out what their feelings are and to be patient to them when they need us. However, doing activities alone have also its own benefits.
In fact, personal activities or some of them we do alone can give us some understanding about how the world is spinning around us as well. Firsthand, sometimes we need to do a few activities alone as this can help us to develop some personal important life skills to know exacly who we really are and what is our mission on the earth. Second, doing personal activities such as walking out, or going for a walk will not only strengthen our physical being but also to be mentally healthy.
In conclusion, both of them have positive and negative aspects to consider. However, in my opinion, doing activities in group or as a team can teach more important life skills than those activities which are done alone because group activities let us explore the world around us which will later teach us important skills which are necessary for our survival.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,"Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals' right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people's love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one's diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.",8.0,7.5,"Scores: 7, 8"
2,Write about the following topic.Bullying is a big problem in many schools.What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is an ever-increasing number of bullying activities in numerous schools. Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.
To begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.
Apart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.
In light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques. Additionally, it might be better to leave the school and move into high-qualified schools rather than confront the bullies.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

What can be done to encourage them to walk more?","The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Gay marriages are becoming a very relevant topic of discussion because of the mixed opinions surrounding it. Some people firmly believe that they are bad for society, whereas others preach that people should be free to choose the person they want to be with for the rest of their life, regardless of gender. I endorse freedom of choice and following your heart and for those reasons I support the idea of gay marriages being legal and widly accepeted.
In today's world people are thought to treat everyone equally, to accept other people's desires and opinion and not to judge them based on that. Morals that did not exist in that past. Happiness should not be judged or illegal. When a person is happy he will want to give back and help others by, for example, volunteering and solving public issues and participating in charity organisations.
Furthermore, the acceptance of gay marriages has other great effects. For example, gay people biologially cannot have offspring. This has two main benefits . Firstly, world population is growing at an alarming rate and gay marriages help lower that rate of birth because of their biological nature. Secondly, if a gay couple decides that they want to have a child, they can addopt one. That is great because nowadays orphanages are a shellter for many kids who do not have a family.

To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Some people strongly argue that money has to be shared for other ways. In contrast, it is necessary to invest money for developing the technology for space exploration. Although there are some benefits to spend money for space exploration, I believe the money should be spent for a disparity of wealth and environment.
Initially, developing the technology for space exploration is necessary to some extent. For example, if people found a drastically innovative resource on another planet that takes the place of current resources, specifically, fossil fuel, and wood.
People do not need to take care of limited resources on the earth any more. In addition, improving technology will cause to people's convenience on earth as a result. For example, recently some scientists are planning to launch a space rocket as a transport system on earth. hat it takes only two hours between New York and Shanghai by rocket.
On the other hand, there are a lot of problems on earth. Especially, in developing countries, people are suffering from poverty while in developed countries waste massive food. In addition, even in developed countries, the disparity of wealth has been widening. Therefore, the money which is spent on space exploration should be used for all people's lives more safely around the world. Developed countries must have many options to give a hand to developing countries. For example, it must be effective to provide infrastructure, agriculture, and sharing clothing and food that are about to dispose of in developed countries.
Finally, including my opinion, people can not choose their own nationality. This means that people who were born in a developing country and need to be suffered from poverty are definitely unfair. Therefore, the money is spent on space exploration partially spend for developing countries. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider and people will be able to live with the same quality of lifestyle as developed countries to some extent.",7.0,5.5,"Scores: 5, 6"
2,"Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?","Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one's disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well.

2,Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, due to increasing of crime rate, some people tend to think of the best way to decline crime is giving a longer prison sentences. However, some criticisms probably believe that there should have much better ways to decrease crime. In my opinion, that is true to some extent for this statement. That means the prison sentences may be necessary, but I perfer the other ways such as education and detenion center rather than the prison sentences, especially for minors.
Firstly, it is possible to said that increasing the punishment would decline the crime in the society. Considering the fact that most of citizens afraid to lose their freedom as a longer time. Given the circumstance, Hong Kong goverment established a policy which force people to scan the QR code with the Leave Home Safe app for against the Covid-19, it was not very common initially without any punishment, yet after announcing the 10-year prison sentences amd 60-throusand-dollar fines, HongKongers use the app quite often now. So that probably means that the more punlishment they will get, the more attentive and cautious they will have.
On the other hand, it seem likely to have another proper ways to reduce the crimes . One example is creat a better and well-rounded education for people, particularly for youngsters. Some people could think of it is a more efficient way to develop and nurture thier manner for their whole life. For example, there are a lot of different kind of extra curriculums which consist of having a talk with polices and ICAC for students to join and teach them some form of concept to be a good citizen and take their responsibilities living in Hong Kong. Perhaps, it can show them some societal expectation rather than arresting them and destroy their future.
To summarize, there are different opinions for this statement. Even so, I believe that if we had spoon-feed information and set a better model for people, it will help people to reflect on their bad behaviour. Likewise, if goverment only established a lot of punishment for his residents consisently, they may feel stress out.

It is so essential that almost every student has already had it in their home or even on their hand. However, I believe that everything in this world has two impacts, either drawbacks or benefits. In this essay, I will explain my opinion about both sides with relevant examples and experiences.
If we go back to 20 years ago, only a few schools already had computers in their classrooms to support their education programs. Nevertheless, as technology never stops improving, thus the computer itself is getting cheaper every day. Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there always be risks to that. In this case, students may use computers for personal reasons unrelated to the lesson. For instance, they can play a game on the internet or access any prohibited website in the classroom.
Despite the risks, there are also several benefits that students will have from computers. First, it will give them a lot of positive information or knowledge, not only related to Information Technology but also to other matters. For example, schools can provide an e-learning program for any subject, containing materials to be learned in the classrooms and homework to be done by students. Furthermore, it will help not only students but also teachers when reviewing the students' homework with computers.
After all, the benefits of computers in classrooms sometimes outweigh the drawbacks. However, schools must consider the mitigation of any unrelated use of computers if they want to provide computers in their classrooms.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers' productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology's contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task.

Classical music which is considered one of the oldest forms of music. It has been a part of history.If we look at the early 1800's or at early 1900's it was always classical music that garnered most attention and had people coming into concert halls to listen to musicians.It was an integral part of music in all countries.But with the evolution of music and introduction of more genres of music like Rock,Pop and Rap we have seen the rise in music which people found more appealing and intresting.
This has led to classical music being viewed as boring and stagnant, this can be viewed as the primary cause in fall of the popularity of classical music.
For example, going to a rock and roll concert which gets people involved and also allows them an opportunity to partake in the concert, which as you could understand would appeal more to the youth as compared to a classical concert where people would just view and appreciate with minimum involvement.
Classical music is also a skilled art that needs to be learned and honed but does not integrate any modern art. For example, Michael Jackson integrated dancing with his singing which widely appealed to the masses and encouraged youth into his concerts. So if you could see a similar integration with classical music concerts it could attract more youth towards classcial music.
Howerver, with this discussion we cannot forget that as various genres of music have been derived from classical music and youth learning classical music with attending more classical concerts would help them achieve their future music endevors and also give them a good understanding of music.
In conclusion, we can say that young people should be encouraged to go to classical music concerts as it would help them understand and appreciate music in its true form.However, attracting young towards classical music will need a evolution in classical music concert structure and integrate some components from other forms which would make it blend better with present day outlook.",7.5,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"

There is an ongoing debate about whether it is essential or not to invest money in family celebrations. In my opinion, spending a lot of money on family celebration would definitely bring more precious experiences to us. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, squandering my own money for my family is significantly meaningful. Specifically, an important person for us, such as my wife or my children, may be out of my sight suddenly someday. Nobody can predict what is going to happen in the future. Above all, regular appreciation toward them with spending a lot of money might enable us not to regret what we did to them if something tragic happened. To be more specific, a scientific report revealed that having a deep and peaceful relationship with someone ended up improving the quality of life. It is manifest that spending money on the family could bring us advantages in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that paying money for myself is a major contributor to improving my happiness, However, closer examination would reveal that not spending a lot of money for others end up bringing us loneliness. There are a lot of things we feel satisfied with spending money for others in the world. The compelling example of this is that having a trip with someone, surely having a good relationship, enables us to feel more satisfaction than alone. I suppose that spending money for others is a key to making myself more happier.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In reality, translation softwares makes a lot of people's lives easier when communicating with others that don't speak the same language. However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.
First of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.
In fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.
Furthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.
One of them is that there's no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, ""Saudade"" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.
Besides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn't consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.
Lastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn't understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.
To illustrate this, when talking to the AI ""Siri"" on the iPhone or ""Alexa"" on Google, a lot of the time they don't comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.
In conclusion, I believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software. In fact, this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

Some people believe that only those who are naturally gifted can perfrom greatly in fields such as art and sport while others do not. This essay will discuss both views and illustrate why anyone through constant practise and hardwork can have a bright future in both of these fields, whether it was sports or art.
Having natural talent in art or sports is surely an advantage that could lead to accomplishments in the future. It puts the person levels above those who are not as fortunate as him or her. For instance, Lionel Messi, arguably the best player to ever kick a ball, is considered by many football fans the most talented play in history. According to Messi's coach, he is not the most dedicated player out of his teammates since he does not put in the same amount of effort as many others, but he certaintly yields the best results. Personally, whenever I see him play, I feel that there is a unvisible force of attraction, similar to a magnet, between his foot and the ball. There are many examples where people invested many hours of their day into learning art, but could not produce something of high quality. My sister, who is 26 years old, is actually one of those examples. She spent 2 hours a day for four years practising art, but she could not draw better than my cousin, who is 12 years and rarely does any drawing.
On the other hand, if someone is willing to put in the work and ready to face whatever it takes to reach the top, he or she will definitely do so, even if no natural is found. After all, certain skills are needed in any field, including sport and art, and by frequent training, those skills could easily be aquirred. One of my close friends was overweight and could not score a single goal in a 90-minute handball match.

However, when it comes to whether living in a metropolis would do bad to people's health, individuals hold different views. As far as I am concerned, it does diminish individuals' health conditions.
Undoubtedly, living in a metropolis has some benefits for the inhabitants' health. A big city is more likely to provide individuals with high level medical services which can be helpful when people are afflicted with various diseases. Precisely, there are numerous community clinics as well as large hospitals where individuals can get access to offering people the most advanced medical technology and medicines. Thus, greater recovering possibilities are provided by big cities for sick people.
However, urban life can also be unhealthy due to numerous reasons. Firstly, individuals tend to suffer from greater mental stress in a metropolis. Specifically, the increasingly higher housing price contributes to the heavy financial burdens of individuals. People are compelled to struggle with high-intensity works due to the high cost in housing, which would cause a high mental pressure. Besides, one of the reasons for individuals' mental pressure can be the indifferent relationship among urban inhabitants which is caused by the lack of a sense of community.
Furthermore, the poor air condition which is caused by the remorseless rush of pollution in big cities does do harm to citizens' health conditions. For instance, the waste gas that discharged by the cars in the streets and the factories is polluting the air in urban areas, leading to a higher rate in diseases. As a result, citizens' health conditions can be diminished physically.
In conclusion, although a metropolis can provide advanced medical services to urban inhabitants, living in big cities can also be hazardous to individuals' mental heath and body health due to numerous factors. In my opinion, living in a metropolis is more likely to undermine people's health.",7.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, universities are accepting all the students, as many men as women in every subject matter. I believe that being open to all students is fair. The university must allow everyone to study what is interesting for each individual, regardless of gender.
However, I think that the numbers of equality in each course are statistically speaking unrealistic. Even though, in general, I completely agree that there must be equality and human rights.
Nowadays, many are the organizations created, to support equality, sex discrimination, with the aim of helping people to get their rights. However, despite enormous positive changes compared to the past, still, some people reckon that some jobs are for women and others for men. What does it even mean? Should a woman only do house chores and raise kids? As can be seen, based on women's experience, a woman can be a businesswoman and a great mother at the same time. There is an old saying, 'Give me an educated mother and I will give you an educated nation'. Therefore, I disagree with some people's beliefs. Men and women can be great in different jobs and positions.
However, having the same number of students in each course is impractical for universities. Realistically speaking, there are some courses which attract more one gender than the other. In terms of numbers, if we think that, for instance, in the nursery degree there is 50 % of females and, then the other half will be waiting to be filled form males, it would be harsh for the university to close the course with the same parity of future students.
In a nutshell, universities should not accept only one gender for a particular course or most of that gender with a fixed number. As the applications arrive at the university, they should select people based on their skills, knowledge, and merits. No matter if the course will be 80% females and 20% male or vice versa.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

In one hand , smokers are luch of awareness alternative of stress reduction. Thus most of the smoker believe that smoking is the best solution to releave the stress that they face in their daily lives. For example, nowadays we see many of employees are smoking during their working hours to beat the stress and headache.

This prove clearly that smoking is just a habit.

What are the solutions to make people drink less.,"Sugar-based drinks has become a popular beverage amongst the people especially in today's generation, the millenials. This essay will outline possible reasons on why people are consuming such drinks and also some ways for them to consume less.
To start, sugar is the main component of this beverage. Study shows that consuming this can boost a person's energy levels. Hence athelete ae addicted to this refreshments such as energy drinks. Furthermore, this can increase mental alertness especially to working individuals. For instance, not all workers has the capability to maintain their energy at work, sometimes they tend to get sleepy leading them to buy sugary drinks like milk teas. Not only that, advertisement can also be a factor. For example, young people gets curious whenever new sugared drinks is advertised especially if this is shown by their favorite icon. Lastly, consumer's lack of knowledge and misinformation regarding their product as evident by the coca cola lawsuit.
Although it may be difficut for people to stay away from this. There are ways that can help them drink less. One solution is for government to impose a price hike. Meaning high price can discourage them to buy this drinks. Second, just like alcohol, buying sugar-based drinks at malls or grocery store should have time limit. For instance, whoever will buy and sell beyond the allotted time should pay a fine. Also, Educating the public about the health issue of drinking too much sugar-based drinks should be prioritize. Finally, government should encourage company such as pepsiCo, and the Coca-cola company to be transparent of their nutritional facts.

2,Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people strongly blame that the government does not control the rise in obesity in children. Although the government needs to take responsibility to some extent, I disagree with this idea.
Firstly, people need to consider, who needs to take responsibility for raising children. It is obviously their parents. This means that if parents gave well controlled, and balanced nutritious food to children, it would be possible to prevent the rise in obesity. Therefore, parents need to consider their children's health as a top priority, instead of criticizing the government. Therefore, parents first need to master cooking.
On the other hand, some countries face a high percentage of obesity in children is higher than in other developed countries. This means that some food that contains too much sugar might be sold cheaper than healthy food, vegetable, chicken, fish, and so on. Therefore, parents who are suffering from poverty tend to choose cheaper, and unhealthy food. This is understandable that governments need to control the prices between healthy food and too much sugar and fat contained food.
Finally, in my opinion, however, some food contains too much sugar, fat, and too high calories are cheaper, so parents need to consider their children's health as the first priority. Although the government controlled the food prices between unhealthy food and wholesome food, the parents continued choosing unhealthy food and never cooked meals, and the rise in obesity in children remains the same. Therefore, the most important point is parents need to educate themselves about nutrition and observe their children's diet. If they learned and made some effort to provide healthy food to children, the percentage of obesity will drastically drop.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

While there are strong arguments in favour of teaching children at home, I still believe positive sides of going to school outweigh the opposite view.
On the one hand, there are obvious arguments why some people may prefer to teach their children at home. Children safety is the most common reason. Everyday way to and from school is a persistent danger for the younger generation as thousands of children become victims of the road accidents every year. Some other safety concerns include negligence of the teachers, while being stretched by the dozens of students, and criminal incidents such as mass shootings that are not so rare in the recent few years.
On the other hand, attendance of school provides learners with some essential social skills and help them to benchmark themselves versus their peers and subsequently to move forward. Interaction with people, work together on something and even competition in some aspects are key for future adjustment to the adult life. The recent study suggests that those primary school students that had started their education before the outbreak of the covid are on average show better results on various tests. Furthermore, education in the school tends to motivate most of the children via competition within the group.
In conclusion, there could be different opinions on whether teaching children at home is better than school education as there are certain advantages and drawbacks. I strongly believe that school education brings more benefits and couldn't be equally replaced by study at home",7.0,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"
2,Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?,"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn't change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people's routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.",8.0,8.0,"Scores: 8, 8"

This type of information should be banned from being televised or printed in the media.
In my opinion, It is more beneficial to the public to know what is happening around us so I disagree with the statememt above.
Nowadays, you can access different news outlet through television or using your phone as long as you are connected to the internet. Reading or watching the news are more and more accessible to the public. By merely, clicking the link we are able to read or watch the latest news in our area.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In most people's life, music takes a special place. No matter if one's favourite is classical, pop, rock, or rap, it can help people distract their attention from unwanted thoughts, alleviate stress, or even reduce pain. My strong belief is that music has a significant psychological effect in maintaining mental health, and some of its most vital impacts are visible on mood and stress.
Music can induce extremely strong changes in people's mental states. There are several everyday examples that highlight the tranquillizing effect of music. Many people find out merely by instinct that they tend to calm down by listening to their favourite tunes. When someone feels anxious before an important exam, a medical visit, or a long-awaited date, music can provide a couple of minutes escape from these stressful situations, on our way to the event's venue. Soft music is also frequently utilized during meditative activities, such as yoga or relaxation. Additionally, people can come across the same type of calming tunes in dental or medical settings as well. However, these are quite passive coping techniques.
On the other hand, there are more active possible mechanisms by which music can reduce stress. When dancing or working out to upbeat music, people decrease their stress levels through movement. It can be an even more efficient way to let the harmful energies behind because of a two-way effect: music tends the soul, while the movement is good for the body, reducing tension in the muscles.
In summary, based on the above-reviewed examples of how music can be helpful in stress-relief, we can see that there is two possible mechanism, a passive and an active, which can play a role in this phenomenon.",7.0,7.5,"Scores: 7, 8"

Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government's responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others' lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction.

As a result, they put their own health at stake because obesity have strong negative effects on it. Nevertheless, I believe that governments are not responsible for the rise in obesity in children as they often warn people to avoid unhealthy food, and advise them to stay in good physical condition by promoting physical activity.
On the one hand, there are some people who claim that governements are responsible for this phenomenon because they do not prevent big companies of fast food like Mac Donald from spreading in the country. As a result, they think that children will be increasingly attracted by this type of food.
However, I do not agree with this argument. For example, USA governement has invested a lot of money in the promotion of organic food for children. In fact, more advertisements about that can now be seen regularly on TV. Moreover, a lot of canteens in schools in America have been obliged to propose healthy menus which contain organic food for children in order to keep them in good health.
On the other hand, other people argue that governments are keen on making profit, so they prefer to promote TV programms for children, which are very addictive, rather than physical activity. Consequently, young people do not want to do sport as they do not move constantly, so they gain weight easily.
Nevertheless, I find this argument not relevant because evidence shows that children are more active than ever before nowadays. For instance, in France, the government has constructed more than 50 000 sport facilities in the country over the 10 past years. This brought about a significant increase in children who practice sports regularly.
To conclude, I am conviced that governments all over the world have been putting a lot of efforts in order to prevent children from obesity, since most of them have promoted organic food as well as physical activity for young people.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized.

In my opinion, buying products such as books, clothes or air tickets on internet have a lot of advantages that could balance the disadvantages.
Firstly, one of the positive aspect is that online it is possible to compare the same product at different prices in order to chose the best deal. Furthermore, we have the possibility to buy in a faster way, without wasting time and finding the best article. Indeed, in local shops it isn't always possible to find what we are searching for, while in the large shopping centre the research of the right thing takes time and it isn't so easy.
Another advantage of shopping on the Internet is that in a single website, such as Amazon, you can find multiple types of product, from book to clothes or furniture. In this way you can buy different things without spending too much time moving from one place to another.
On the other hand, buying online could have some disasvantages. For example, on the shopping websites there are lots of spam messages that offer you products at special prices.

To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone's income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone's income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it.

2,More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The problem of understainding whether there is an age that could be consider perfect to have a child is very debated. It is nowadays very common to have children over 40 years old. After explaining the reasons besides this tendency (a different life-style and conception of education and the role that women play in our society), I will argue in favour of this tendency by explaining that the disadvantages can be outweighed.
The reasons why today people have children in their later age are due to two factors. Firstly, there is a new conception of education and people when finish their studies sometimes have to wait years before finding a good paid position. On the other hand, new technologies and new medical treatments have made people around 60 looking in the same way as my grandmother was in her 40. The central cause of this tendency is surely linked with the role that women play in our society. They study and work and they have to find a good job position in the same way as their male counterparts have to do. This involve that a woman cannot take the time that she need to grow up a child when she is 25 (at that age she is usually in Academia yet). Rather, she will think about the possibility of having a child after started her career. Then, there are positive effects produced by this new tendency. Children are loved and considered by their parents as miracles. On the other hand, they can grow up in a family in which his parents have good jobs. Neither the mother or the father have to sacrifice a part of their life because they had a child too young.
My mum got me when she was over 40. Twenty-three years ago this was consider an exception. Although I confronted my-self with the possible disadvantages that could be produced by having child late, I cannot present them as real issues. People believe that a not-young parent cannot understand your needs and your thoughts. However, this is false. Indeed, If a person is open-minded, she will always is, whatever the age. The only possible disadvantage concerns the fear of losing your parents soon. While people start to think about the possible death of their parents when they are around 30 years old, I started to think about that when I was 20. But it is just fear. Therefore, I believe that there are not concrete reasons to be against this tendency. If we start to conceive the idea of having a baby as an immense gift, we will reasonably have to understand that we have to be prepared to grow up the child and to dedicate to him all the time he needs. Then, it is amazing if this is possible to have all of this when a woman is 25. But, if the family (father and mother together) wants to start their career first, they cannot be judged. There is not a perfect moment to have a child. Sometimes to wait involve do better.

Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.
An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.
However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.

At first, showing the violent events can decresae some serious crimes.

Take abusing drugs for example, people will afraid to touch drugs if they can vividly see the serious outcomes of abuse, which can effectly prevent them to do some crimnal things. Thus, there wil be less crimes and other kinds of violent events happened in our society.
Secondly, restricting the news of crimes to the public may increase the rate of crimes.

When they have to choose whether to do or not, they can not consider more details of the serious outcomes for different kinds of criminal events and they just do it.

And it will assist bulding the child's character, in addition to, other fundemental traits. Like for example, gaining self-esteem, and leading skills, and so on ...
Likewise, it is children nature to be too energetic- generally speaking- so going to school, and playing with their friends, can be the best way for them to get rid of this energy. For instance, if the kid was running around the house, he propably would get scolded by his parents. Because at home there is no much space like outside. In addition, it is for the child's physical health to be active and go outside, not stay at home all day.
Overall, I believe that it is a better option for them to go to school instead of getting home-schooled. As well as, communication and playing with other children which can be a proper way for them to get developed mentally and pysically.",5.5,5.5,"Scores: 6, 5"
2,Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Education is one of the most important topics for childhood development, and music can be very beneficial to children because it helps to sustain creative thinking and improve imagination. Some educators demand that music should be taught as a mandatory subject, and yet some others think that forcing children to play music instruments will limit their chances to discover and develop other talents.
Indeed, music can be a great source for improving the lives of many children as well as their learning experience. Learning music instruments requires patience, creativity and good discipline. Inherently, in order to master a music instrument, a good musician needs to sharpen his preserverence and offer all his best, for a great performance often demands ten or more years of practice. The heart of a musician, the pursuation of perfection and persistence are all good qualities for a child to learn throughout his life in pursuing his career, not only the career in music.
However, despite all the good qualities that can be obtained through playing music instruments, childhood education can be misdirected if the development of a hobbie becomes ""mandatory"", which, of ocurse, includes music instruments. It might be beneficial for a child to experiment music instruments in his early years, but not every child has the potential of being a professional musician. Making music a mandatory subject for primary and secondary school students could minimize their opportunities to discover different hobbies. Moreover, making a bobbie a mandatory subject may also hinder the other learning experiences of a young child. Just imagine how stressful it is to study an unecessary subject on top of regular courses and other homework. It does more harms than goods to the overall learning experience.
In conclusion, it might be beneficial for a child to learn music instruments in his first school years, but if he does not have the talent and does not enjoy music, educators should consider dropping such suggestion and let him discover other hobbies.",7.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is proposed that elementary schools should teach their pupils vegetable growing and animal keeping skills. Although there are controversial views towards this proposal, I believe that its benefits outweigh its drawback for a range of reasons stated below.
On the one hand, experiences of vegetable growning and animals keeping can help children develop some first hand knowledge and some key characters that would benefit them in the long run. Firstly, by involving in the process of vegetables growing, children gain in-depth understanding of the nature and its impact on the development of a life cycle. In this case, they are capable of learning some practiacal knowledge regarding how weather and seasons could either foster or destruct the growth of plants. Secondly, keeping pets or other animals can encourage the deveopment of the pupils' responsibility. As they learn how to rountinely feed animals, and take showers for them, their responsbility and empathy also grow hand in hand, which would lay a solid foundation for their future study, family life and professional career.
On the other hand, it may be argued that taking such courses could distact students from their intensive study. It is not necessarily true because the aforementioned knwledge and skills can be transferble to their academic study and social life in schools. For example, their first hand experiences of growing vegetables can advance their understanding of some theoretical knowledge about plants in the bilogy class. The empathy deveoped through raising animlas could be also taken advantage to strengthen relationships with teachers and peers.
In conclusion, it is understandable that some people oppose the idea of the pupils learning vegetables growing and animals keeping, but I strongly think that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",7.5,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"
2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people argue that individuals can't do nothing to resolve the environmental problems of our times. Personaly, I partially disagree with this statement and in this essay I will go through some of the arguments that back my opinion.
On one hand, I have to agree with this statement. Many of the environmental problems that we are currently facing are caused by large companies and not by individuals. Whether it's pollution, deforestation or contamination, the indivual doesn't have as much impact as these entities have. Therefore, governements should take care of the problem rather than passing into the current citizen. In addition, the solutions that are needed to take place require an important political and economical influence. Only the governments are available to put in place the measures needed to counter-balance this situation.
On the other hand, waiting to be saved by the governments and institutions is not the right attitude. Individuals, while not having the same impact, can spark the change that is needed in order to take care of this problem. Not only that but citizens can make their contribution by applying some small measures than by itselfs aren't noticeable but when summed up can have a positive impact. For example, recycling their food waste or using ecological friendly products are habits that we can all do. If only one person does it, it won't have any effect, but it does when it's done by one million,
In conclusion, it can be said that both sides are needed in order to make a positive change on the current situation. This can start from the individual to then put in motion a bigger change.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

The author agree with the statement that the technology and traditional cultures may find it hard to co-exist. As the reserach and development of human beings increases the birth of new technologies are inevitable. When a new technology is invented, mostly the new member of our living environment disrupts the traditional standards.
For example, prior to the internet era we used to communicate less through the mobile devices and tend to have face to face conversations. This is often true while considering a chat between our family members. On occasions like birthday, a festival season like Christmas we used to go in person to greet the loved ones. However, as technology evolved and traditional jobs are swept away people migrated to locations with more opportunities and often these are far from the native places. This situation along with the communication platforms built above internet like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat make us feel like we do not have to travel so far just to wish for a special occasion when we can do the same easily on a mobile device.
From the authors experience it is clearly understood that he traditional cultures are now covered by the clouds of new technologies which threatens the survival of many hunam beings. For example, with the innovation in the banking sector, the customers are now able to transact through their mobile application. They do not have to visit the brick and mortar braches anymore.

2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"With the development of technology, there is a debate whether advanced communication technology would be a major contributor to worsening human relationships in modern society. In my opinion, the developing communication tool could have negative impacts on social relationships in the future. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, new technology could be out of control at an early phase of introduction. New technologies certainly enable us to live conveniently as a result, however, it often takes some time to fit them into our lifestyles under the control. Above all, the latest tool could bring worsened effects on society than we expect. To be more specific, bullying with the use of smartphone is one of the major problems all over the world today. It is manifest that new communication tools can easily devastate human relationships in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that new communication tools make it possible that people across the world can have a chat without physical moving to another place. But closer examination would reveal that the introduction of new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities for people to meet up in person. A compelling example of this is that Japanese people have less relationship with their neighborhood than in the post. People living today might be satisfied with tons of telecommunication rather than direct communication. I strongly suppose this is also a negative effect on social relationships with the use of new technology.
Having considered all the above, I strongly believe that modern communication tools would lead to a negative result for social relationships because of uncontrollable aspects of the latest technology and loss of communication in person with the use of new communication tools.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree),"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child's life; parents should obtain different information related to their child's vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual's point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer's position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word 'kids' should be replaced with 'children' everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it's not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing.

2,Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is an opinion which is that the longer prison sentences is the best solution to reduce crime. On the contrary, some people say that there are better solutions to solve this problem. Overall, I totally agree with the latter opinion because I think that giving long prison sentences can not directly reduce crime.
Firstly, I observe the advantage about giving longer prison sentences. Surely, people may hesitate to commit crime by strict sentences. Even if they would commit crime, they would have to be in prison for long days. In addition, living in prison for a long time may give a time to reflect themselvs for them.
However, if crimers would be in the prison for a long time, it might be difficult for them to make them living on themselves because they might not be used to the social reality. It may cause them to commit crime again.
In addition to this, I think the poverty and a lot of burdens which people have may cause to commit crime. Because of two reasons, I think that countries have to propose policies which can stimulate economy and relieve their anxieties. Recently, many countries have experienced a recession. It cause the increasing the unemployment rate, so a lot of people suffer from hunger because of the povery. It will be supposed to cause them commit crime such as robbing. Then, people have many burdens because of woriking, raising their children and caring their parens. They have a lot of stress, so even if they could not reduce their stress, they might commit crime to reduce their mental pain. They may want a relax time.
I think the latter opinion is more valid than the former by these reasons. These are my opinion about this problem.",6.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"

Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today's world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers' age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one's age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer's position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression.

2,The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"The use of social media nowadays is widespread around the world. As the use of new techonology grows, people concern about what will be impact of this change. Some people argue the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among people, which will lead to negative impacts on the society. Whereas, Others claim that the benefits from the use of social media outweigh the negative impacts. Which one is true? I will compare these two perspectives and state my opinion in this essay.
There is no denying that the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction to some extent. People use social media to connect with other people. This kind of behaviors decrease the aspiration of real life interaction. However, using social media can not give the same feeling as a face-to-face interation. There is lack of intimacy and empathy. For this reason, it is easy to fall in lonelyness while occupied in social media.
However, sometimes the use of social media assists the interactions in real life. For example, friends who are far away from each other can interact in social medias. This helps to keep their relationship which can lead to a face-to-face interaction in the future. Moreover, some people even find out their lover through social medias.
In my opinion, the argument that the use of social media will replace face-to-face interaction is a little bit exaggerated. After all, most people use social media to assist their real life relationship, not to completely replace their face-to-face interactions with online chattings. The use of social media might replace some portion of face-to-face interaction, but in most cases, it will help us to connect with other people, and promote our real life interactions.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.
It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married.

Also, imagine if students don't have homework, instead of playing outside, they will rather watch televisions or play video games. In fact, doing homework sharpens your skills in what you practice, like mathematics or memorizing skills.
If students can manage their time, they won't feel stressed or tired. Because they didn't do it right away, and the homework stacked up, this made them not want to do it anymore.

They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products' health benefits without fully understanding what's being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing.

Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can't be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a 'virtual library' as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.",9.0,8.0,"Scores: 8, 8"
2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Throughout history, adult people have been those who worked on farms and they also were responsible for breeding animals. Recently, it has been suggested that kids in elementary schools should also take part in such occupations. In this essay, I will count possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such a change in life, in order to conclude whether or not it is a cost effective notion.
It is commonly believed that the enviroment has been endangered by imminent risks. Some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment. Thus, teaching children how to raise up vegetables and how to get along with pets can probably strengthen bonds between children and nature in early phases of life. Furthermore, If children grew plants in early stage of life, they would develop unique creative skills alongside enhancing their productivity. Moreover, some experts claim that treating animals may benefit children as it would improve their social and communicational skills.
On the other hand, there is another aspect which merits futher consideration. Some plants are known to be poisonous and unsafe to young people. In addition, growing plants and spending time on farms might make children prone to a few insects and reptiles which can be really dangerous. Finally, animals could be harmful if they are treated inappropriately.
To recapitulate, as we try to wiegh up the pros and cons of such an enterprise, I still reckon that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages. However, in order guarantee the possible advantages I have mentioned upun above, certain safety measures should be taken to offset the potential risks opposed to children as they are in proximity to plants and animals.",7.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The next essay will talk about the reasons behind the need of some people to find out about their own family history.
I believe in certain young countries as USA for example, it is completely logical to feel the need of getting to know where your roots come from.
We have to take into account that in many cases a sector of the USA population only know the nationality or the history of their grandparents, and their grandparents have very few information of their own parents, so the total history of their family is quite sort. I am spanish and lived for one year in the state of Washington with an american family. It was very surprising for me to find out how proud that family was of its european roots. It took me a while to understand their feelings. I needed to put myself into their shoes. To give a live example, my american Dad had even visited the northern part of Norway, close to the Artic Polar Circle to look for a distant cousin he had figured out he had. My american Dad was the happiest person on earth when showing the picture of his cousin and him taking a beer in Norway.
I believe there are many reasons for someone to dig into history to have a deeper knowledge of his own family. Firstly you may get a better understanding of the behaviours of your closest relatives. Also you can find the reasons behind the colour of your skin or your eyes.
To summarise, I strongly believe it is positive to get to know more about your own roots and about your distant relatives to get a better understanding of youself.",6.0,5.5,"Scores: 5, 6"
2,"The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, the Internet has become without doubt the most powerful, convenient and free source of information and communication. It has dramatically changed how we communicate with each other and how we obtain news. With only one push of button on our devices like a smart phone or a laptop we can speak our family members who are thousand miles away from us or read current news without a need for watching TV or buying a newspaper. However, this convenience of the Internet carries some potential threats to the users such as violation of their privacy rights and overflow of unreliable information. Therefore, the users should demand some forms of regulations of the Internet to reduce these risks.
Certainly, the use of the Internet needs to be regulated if we want to preserve our privacy when using it. Unfortunately, there is an enormous flow of our personal data on the Internet. For example, we eagerly share a lot of information about ourselves simply from our name, address, phone number to more serious one like our accounts number or social security. However, the big sales companies very often buy an access to this data to target us and influence our choices. This practice should be illegal and we as the users need to have a say how our personal data should be handled on the Internet. For this reason, we need to demand privacy laws to have better control how our personal information is managed on the Internet.
Another risk of having the Internet free from regulation is that we have no means of protection from unreliable information. I find this risk very dangerous since many people have used the Internet as their primary source of news and rely on it to stay updated with daily news. Now, anybody can become a reporter as long as he or she has access to the Internet. Simply, people can write and post their comments that often don't have any factual or scientific base. We have witnessed this misinformation during the debate regarding vaccinations for the COVID-19. Many people who objected to be vaccinated made up their mind reading some posts on the Facebook or the Twitter that stated harmfulness of vaccines. These posts are allowed to be posted, because the social media don't have any obligation to check the content of posts. Clearly, this wouldn't happen if there were some forms of regulations that can verify better factual content of information on the Internet, so the potential readers can avoid the risk of misinformation.
Surely, the Internet can no longer stay without any regulatory laws. These policies are necessary to protect our privacy and keep us informed with more reliable information. Simply, the regulation polices of the Internet give us more power to be in control when using the Internet to obtain information or share personal data.",7.5,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"
2,Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?,"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates' personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers' qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate's personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates' individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates' qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee's personal qualities fit in a company's culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company's vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates' personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","Nowdays the developping of modern technologies in the trade sphere provokes a lot of discussions. Some people notice significant simplification in shopping process because of these technologies whereas the other part of society denies this influence. As far as I am concerned, shopping has definitely become easier due to invention of new payment decisions.
On the one hand it is really difficult to ignore the creation of new payment decisions in the last decades likewise internet acquiring or different mobile technologies like Apple Pay, Google Pay etc. The two key features of all these innovations have become, firstly, decreasing the number of steps in the payment process and absence of visualisation of your own money as well since you pay by card or by phone, not by your cash. Because of these changes now the shopping is really easier for us regarding spending our money without any possibilities for extra thoughts.
At the same time some people can declare that due to modernisation and development of technologies a lot of companies and factories have started to create a huge variety of goods. As a consequence, customers usually struggle with choosing of what they actually need. At this point of view it is possible to regard the modernisation not as something to make the shopping easier but as the opposite of it. To clarify, the faster development is going on, the more confused an average customer is becoming because the harder for him to choose something and buy it.
As for my personal opinion, I concern the progress as something that usually helps me to buy goods. To elaborate, I have never had any issues with choosing in the shopping that is why it is difficult for me to express some empathy to the people who feel uncomfortable with it.
I can conclude thus that the question of technologies and their influence in simplification in shopping is debatable. There are some who spend their money easier then ever since the number of steps in the payment process has decreased, but there are customers who have issues and find the same process less comfortable. As for me, I am inclined to the first groop of people because I've also noticed a rised pace with that I've started to make my purchases.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Both types of learning have advantages as well as drawbacks and this essay will highlight both sides of the situation.
The knowledge of food science is admired at some educational institutions where learners are expected to master this art. Students can gain numerous benefits by acquiring knowledge of food at the school level. For example, they become capable of making a career in the food industry or conducting further research on the science of food at the tertiary level. Therefore, some people prioritize gaining expertise in food science from schools.
However, some scholars support the concept of learning only essential subjects for academic and professional purposes. Firstly, it is wiser to learn academic courses that provide enormous career opportunities for the future. For instance, learning subjects such as science, business studies, and sports can open the door to chances for a student. Secondly, the majority of the prestigious jobs in the world are related to technology, economics, and communication. As a result, studying these courses at schools prepares a learner to gain expertise and thrive in the professional sector.
In my opinion, students studying at schools should use their valuable time for learning essential subjects as it helps them succeed in the future. Courses such as food science can be learned at a later stage of life. For example, adult learners are able to join an academic course on food science as many institutions provide face-to-face and online courses in this regard. However, knowledge of subjects such as science, business studies, and arts is inevitable to achieve success in the future. Hence, the potential time of school students should be utilized to learn necessary subjects for a better outcome.",6.0,6.5,"Scores: 7, 6"
2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"For years, space has fascinated humans. The idea that there could be life on other planets, as well as the challenge of exploring as much of the universe as possible, has been one that has excited everyone from top physicists, to the youngest child playing with her space ship toys. But is the money spent on exploration of the universe justified or should it rather be allocated to helping those on this planet? I believe that space exploration is justified. In this essay, the motivation for space exploration will be explored.
Planet Earth is ill. Humans have polluted the planet and destroying natural resources. Some might argue that the damage is irreparable. Global warming is causing the Earth's temperature to steadily rise. There is a possibility that in the next few centuries, the planet may become inhabitable. Scientists like Elon Musk have recognised the dire situation that the Earth is in, and have started looking for an alternative new home planet. It is possible that in the coming years, there will be no other option than to move to a planet like Mars. Therefore, the costs involved in exploring this planet are justified, if it is to house the entire human race.
Space exploration also allows for new discoveries. New minerals or compounds could be discovered on distant planets. These could possibly be used on Earth in various new technologies, or even in medical science to treat illness or disease. This could be invaluable to humankind.
Since the dawn of the human race, a characteristic that separates us from our animal relatives, is our ability to tinker with existing knowledge, as well as learn new things. It has lead to humans becoming the dominant force on the planet. New ideas prevent us from becoming stagnant, thus driving progress. If we continue to learn new things from space exploration, we prevent stagnation.
Lastly, the idea that there could be life on other planets is one that has merit, in my opinion. Humans cannot be so arrogant to think that there is no other life in the universe.
In conclusion, it can be argued that space exploration does not hold merit and should be discontinued. But the benefits that it offers outweigh the shortcomings.",8.5,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"

Nevertheless, the widespread use of internet also spurs a debate on whether online activities should be controlled or not. Some people hold that such control is necessary, while others disagree and argue that the use of internet should not be restricted. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.
As for those agreeing with the control of online activities, they have their position grounded upon the fact that numerous criminal activities run rampant online and should be tackled effectively, as exemplified by fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and hacking technologies targeted at violating privacy. If unchecked, cybercrimes would increasingly disturb the society and cause widespread complaints. Another reason reinforcing this position is that the online information that is inappropriate for minors should be reduced, such as the movies containing erotic or violent scenes, as well as foul language. Otherwise, children may be led astray by such information, acting improperly at home or school.
In terms of those who barely support online control, they may justify their position by explaining the importance of unlimited internet access to task efficiency. For instance, businessmen could seek potential clients by online searching, which is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street publicizing themselves. However, if internet users cannot identify the authenticity of online information, they may assume the risk of being cheated. Given this concern, a certain extent of intervention is needed for screening fake information.
As far as I am concerned, I opine that online control is justified, because it helps to address multiple cybercrimes and inappropriate information for adolescents. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

In other words, each generation is capable to help the following generation.

other vehicles.
generally, increasing the cost of gas or fuel would decrease the amount of people utilising environment detriment vehicles. Therefore, the air quality will be healthier for both animals and humans.
In my point of view, this decision will lead to several advantages such as increasing the number of people walking and considering bikes as a way to get anywhere they need. Therefore, goverments will change the current cities structure which are fundamentally depending on cars and vehicles. To transform it to a complete new walkable and more practical cities instead. So that kind of actions has benefits not only for the coming few years but also the future as a whole.
To strengthen my opinion, when gas prices are higher than the average the majority of people will consider another transportation methods that are less damaging and more environment friendly, namely metros, modern trains, bikes or even walking around. However, people also must be educated about curtain aspects when it comes to nature and how to not experience a harmful lifestyle in general, for both the nature and the human race.
to summarize, increasing the gas prices without spreading awarness among youngsters equivalently would not be a convenient action.

For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes.

Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes.

For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes.

Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them.

I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue.
On the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field.

By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis.
On the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years.

Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem.

In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently.

Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In some countries, the spread of supermarket has taken a significant proportion such that small shops may disappear. Many individuals believe that the shut down of local business could end the local communities. I fully consider that the generalisation of commercial market could destroy the spirit of localities because if owners closed their business, it would disappear local and familiar places for inhabitants and create a negative mental health.
Before having this modern invention, namely supermakets, local shops such as bakery or butcher have been there and where a place of regroupment and conviviality. However, due to the competitiveness of supemarket and the globalization of items, individuals may prefer to purchase in it rather than to go to each local business. This phenomenon decrease the visits of customers in small shops and would not help to boost their incomes. As a consequence, if local shops, which should be most of them in the city center due to old architecture such as in Europe, shut down, there will be no longer activities or inhabitants, and in the forthcoming decades, the city could be desertic.
Moreover, small businesses created employment, if they closed, people would make redundants. Indeed, in many research when people lose their jobs, it may create a negative mood and at worst sometimes a depression. This is to say that if everyone were discharged due to all those shut down, effects could be detrimental on local communities. For instance, in small cities, many events are organized such as parties or barbecues. However, if the population had a negative mood, anyone would join these activities which, normally, increase the dynamism of a city.
To conclude, I fully think that supermaket is a harmful places for the well-being of localities because it could stop or curb cities' actions.",6.0,5.5,"Scores: 5, 6"

Some believe a child possesses experiences which before starting school have the most important on their future life whereas some advocate the experiences of teenagers most notably their school life are more influential.
To start with the infant to 3 years old is a period of the strongest absorptive capacity. Some think this is the best time to let children learn the different aspect of knowledges and new things. Indeed, it is vital process for a child to explore surrounding events by their infant curiosity. In this period, parents actively encourage their children to cope with new things and embrace their faults that can build up their confidence. This enable a child is willing to face any challenges which he/ she may not be familiar with. It is very important manner to adapt new enviroments and to figure out the solution when they encounter the difficulties in their future life.

It includes some big changes to the body and to the way a young person relates to the world. The many physical, sexual, cognitive, social and emotional changes that happen during this time can bring anticipation and anxiety for adolescents and their families. Simultaneously, they treasure the friendship with mates. It makes the youths to spend much time into their school life that occupy a chunk of their daily time.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay.

2,Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is true that gender equality has achieved significant advancements nowadays compared to society in the past, and women have no doubt obtained more opportunities to get engaged in the leading role on many occasions. With regard to many success stories about female leadership, there is a common statement that women are more suited to be leaders. In my opinion, leadership depends more on ability rather than gender.
There are several reasons why some people may consider females as the better choice to occupy the leading position. Firstly, female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight. In the past, men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm. At the same time, women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management, and in many cases, they were merely not eligible for leadership. Hence, the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in people's minds, which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead. Secondly, the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality. In order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading, it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits. However, the decisive factors to successful leadership, which include capacities like communication, personal charisma, and intelligence, should not be misinformed.
Despite the argument given above, I also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public, which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership. The male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness, intelligence, and dominance, which match the requirement of leadership a lot. It is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well. A prime example can be female chancellor Merkel of Germany, who led the German government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well-known reputation worldwide. Her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males.
In conclusion, although I completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance. However, the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender.",8.0,7.0,"Scores: 7, 7"

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.
The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.
In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.
To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.",7.5,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"

Some people argue that those experiences which a child faces before entering into school has more effect, whereas others believe that teenhood has profound influence on a child's future life. This essay will discuss in detail both the views and explain why i believe that both early childhood and teenage experiences decide what future holds for the child.
Those people, who are in opinion that experiences in early childhood before the start of school has impact on future life, give several reasons. They believe that whatever a child faces at home helps in shaping his personality. For example, abusive childhood greatly has long lasting effect on their lives. It has been studied that those children who are victims of child abuse are more likely to become criminals. Some of them can never return towards normal life. Moreover, parents by their care and love can raise a child with a bright future. These children know the world from the perspective of their parents and it helps them to become a well-mannered and cultured human being with specific life goals, such as getting higher education or finding a job. In short, early childhood has its far reaching effects on a child.
On the other hand, people, who think that teenage experiences , especially at school, have more impact on determining the future of the person, have their own reasons to support their argument. Firstly, it is the phase of life where hormonal changes are taking place and they are experiencing body changes both mentally and physically; therefore, those who can have control on their emotions during this phase can develop as a strong individual. Secondly, it is the phase where most of the teenagers start taking decisions about their future study choices and any study experience at school help them in making these decisions. Such resolutions in teenage can have impact on their future practical lives. Finally, those youngsters, who are bullied during their teenhood at school, can suffer from personality disorder later in their lives which can have detrimental affect on their future. Surely, these experiences in teenage can affect a child's future.

One of such important trait is cooperation which helps indiviual in many stages of life to acheive a collebration and goals. Nowadays, it has been taught in schools through several activities but latley the focus is inclined more towards team sports.
To begin with, lots of private and goverment schools do promote team sports such as volleyball, hockey etc. compare to indiviual sports as their are plenty of advantages which are associated with it. Studies have shown that such sports not only help childrens build strong bond among themselves, however it also inculcate other important traits such as disipline, leadership and planning to achieve common goal which can perhaps help them to stand out in society in future.
Additionally, it increase the confidence which is consider as vital quality in any human beign who wants to outgrow of any challanges which comes in his/her way.

When such childrens are forced to participate in team sports they either end up loosing their self- esteem or judged by their surroundings.

2,"Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","I partially agree to the opinion that hosting an international sports event has positive effects for the country. In most cases It is good for the country as it gives a chance to show off the nation's culture and power, but sometimes the cost of holding the event outnumber the benefits from it. I will break down my opinion here with the examples of Seoul Olympic in 1988 and Tokyo Olympic in 2021.
Seoul Olympic was held in 1988 in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It gave the nation great chance to advertise its prosperity. Many audiences got deep impression on how the country erected from the ashes of Korean war. In addition, the event had an important meaning in diplomacy, as it was an Olympic game that all communist and capitalist countries gathered after a long time. The event was prepared firmly, as South Korean knew how much this game was important to them. South Korea can earn lots of reputation, as well as money from many foreign travellers
On the other hand, Tokyo Olympic was held in 2021, in the middle of pandemic because of Covid-19. It was originally planned to be held in 2020, but postponed because of the danger of mass infection. This delay costed a lot of money to the hosting country. In addition, there were many problems in preparing the event, because of the spread of the disease. Moreover, only small amount of travellers can visit Tokyo to see the game, because of the tight regulations on travel to prevent international transmission of the disease. As a result, the money earned during the game was much less than the cost to prepare it, and its advertising effect was minor.
As we can see in these two cases, hosting an international sports event can be good in some cases, but it can be wasteful in other cases. The success in hosting international games depends on many elements. Time of the game is important, and global atmosphere is important as well. Most of all, how well the country is prepared is a key factor that the event can be successful.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes.

In this essay, I will count the possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such an invention and finally conclude wether or not it is really a cost-effective one.
Over the course of modern history, national and international conferrences have cost enormous funds in order to gather experts from all over the world. However, thanks to the available online communication platforms, present companies and foundations can hold meetings with famous and influencial persons more often and with less expense. Furthermore, nowadays, employees can spare the time spent on travelling between offices and premises, by having online meetings. Meetings are now recorded for documentation and any future purposes. For example, this technology has seemd to be critical on our life, specifcally since the outbreak of COVID19. If humans had not have this means of communication, there would have been more severe and devastating effects on businesses.
On the other hand, there is another aspect which merits further consideration. Unfortunately, techincal network problems could still happen and cause inevitable cancellations. Moreover, meeting other colleagues merely on screens would have a detrimental social impact in workplaces. Without face-to-face interaction peers have less chance to build strong and deep relationships, which in turn might weaken co-opeartion and cohesion in any work environment.
To recapitulate, as we weigh up the pros and cons of this recent innovation, I strongly believe that the prominent advantages outweigh the few disadvantages that I mentioned above.

Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills .

I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as 'group A' and the other group – as 'group B'.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can't do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren't trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can't accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A's salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university.

2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.
The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.
This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.
In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?,"Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.
Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.
Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.
Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Owning to this, some assume that the Governments should abolish this type of sports while others contend that citizens should have a right to immerse in any activities, regardless of its high-risk characteristics. In my opinion, the policies ought to focus on participants's assurance instead of banning any sports.
On the one hand, the propose of prohibiting extreme sports should not be approved because it is against the democratic society. Inevitably, the participating in risky sports is one of residents' rights. As a result, the intervention of the Admistrations in this case will prevent them from their own interests illegally. Moreover, the extreme sports abolishment may extinguish carreers and dreams of numerous professional athletes and trainees. Therefore, banning is not a reasonable approach in this situation.
On the other hand, authorizing freedom in playing dangerous sports generates several matters. Understandably, participants mostly risk their health and lives being involved in these activities, from violence and physical injuries, which means the furious characteristics are posing a threat to their own existences. In addition, the prohibition on those sports can orientate hobby development for future generation on healthy sports, requiring less violence and intension. This, therefore, leads to a more tranquil community.
Finally, according to my perspective, the Administrations should attempt to handle safety assurance and enhance risk education in those players. Under this circumstance, the residents are equipped with protective support and still allowed to enjoy and follow their passion. This then would be the optimal way to meet residents' demand.
Conclusively, I personally believe the solution is not about whether the Governments should forbid furious sports activities, but about providing them protective assurance and risk acknowledgement.",5.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

This essay will demonstrate that teaching the sense of cooperation is the correct way to raise a child, so she will be more useful because it instigates kindness, which makes a healthier individual and a more inclusive society, thus, creating a healthier community.
Although we live in a very competitive world, the constant race for power, a better position corrode the sense of being kind. Every person around becomes a foe, an adversary to be defeated. One may feel entitled to do anything to reach their goals. This behavior will, eventually, change ones personality, making her anxious, depressed if the goals are not achieved or even less prone to comply to the social contract, which results in a more threatening individual than a collaborative one.
A healthy and cooperative society organizes itself around what we call social contract, that is, what we can do or cannot do to not harm the others. This value has to be taught since the very beginning of a person's life; as children have a more open mind; as a consequence of that, one can work on behalf of the society creating a safe space and more inclusive community, where anyone can be contribute, regardless of one's abilities, therefore be useful, in different levels.

I believe there are some drawbacks of this pursuit, but I see more benefits as it might allow researchers and especially travellers to explore natural ecosystem safely without destroying it.
First of all remote travelling will give broad opportunities scientists to research more untouchable natural ecosystems. Those researches' results might play a crucial role to understand our nature well and therefore to take firm steps to protect it. For example, the growing researches showed, that after thourough exploration of the North and South Capes, scientists could finally understand the devastating effect of the Global warming, as researches revealed dramatically melting process of the glaciers. Though remote research might be base for some scientific breakthrough, however in some cases, it's important to be in a place personally to measure changes not only visually but also to take some lab examples.
On the other side, Web net based journey might be good alternative for those tourists who want to explore world but can't spend more money or resources on that journey. In this case remote journey is beneficial for both sides: for the natural environment which is staying safe from tourists' crowds interference, and for the tourists as well, as they shouldn't spend more resources on this kind of traveling. For instance, if person showing willingness to see the natural environment such as rainforest but can't travel, this type of the tourism might be the great chance. Though new technologies allow to see and even listen the natural environment voices whole, however real feelings and emotions of being for instance in the Southern Pole impossible to recieve when you are online.
In conclusion, there are some benefits and disadvantages of the remote traveling and research work that should be taken into consideration. I recommend scientists and tourists first of all to set their traveling goals and then analyze which type of traveling is more convenient for them.",7.0,5.5,"Scores: 6, 5"
2,"In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","At present, it is possible to note that families come in different and diverse structures. Overall, these changes occur because of women are entering the work force, which changes the roles of a traditional family. I strongly believe that these changes are positive to society and to the economy. In the following paragraphs I will present my reasons to have such opinion.
One major factor that affects family structures is women being allowed to work outside their homes. Within the last century, women joined the work force, modifying the traditional family setting that was compoused by men being the ones who provided for their families. Therefore, the roles changed as both mothers and fathers could financially provide for their children. Moreover, women do not need to rely on their husbands to raise children as they have jobs themselves, and they might even decide to raise a baby by their own, creating a new type of family strucutre that is comprised of only a mother and a child. Furthermore, couples can even decide not to have children at all, and only focus on their carreers, as women have the possibility of being a lot more than mothers.
These changes are definitly positive of an economical and societal point of view. Women are now part of the work force, therefore, they contribute for the economy. Besides that, changes in family structures and roles make people more tolerant, as they see that there is no limitation for what a women can do.
To summarize, there are indeed several changes occurring in families structures, and the roles people play in it. Women being part of the work force has changed male and female contribution to a family, which has a positive impact, socially and economically speaking.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","While many regard team sports such as football and basketball are the better choices for sport, there are still some stick on to the individual sports. To my point of view, I prefer individual sports over team sports as the latter is more harmful and less beneficial from both physical and mental perspective.
Firstly, I think sports played in groups tend to cause more harm in the forms of stress and injuries. To start, virtually all team sports are played as competitions: it must have a winnner and a loser, or losers. Since no one wish to be the stepstone of the champion, it causes a tremendous amount of stress on players' psyche. Also, many team sports inevitably requires phyiscal contacts of the players, the competitive nature of such sports often intensify the contact which some leads to injuries. Many famous sportsmen, like Jianlian Yi, one of the only two Chinese basketball players in NBA, were forced to retire early due to the injuries sustained during matches.
On the other hand, individual sports like swimming and joggling do not have such issues. Since one can swim or run alone, there is no such need to compete with others and cause stress. The removal of physical contact with other players also reduce the likelihood of sport injuries such as head-to-head collisions. Plus, one would focus more on how to self-improve on his/her phyiscal abilities. Moreover, some individual sports like joggling and hiking encourage people to explore mother nature. According to a study done by UBC in 2005, the higher exposure to the nature, one will have lesser likelihood to suffer mental disorders such as major depressions disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD).
In conclusion, I would say sports that played individually is has more benefits than team sports, from both the physical and mental point of views.",7.5,5.5,"Scores: 5, 6"
2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"In recent times as technology progresses, majority of people have spent longer time at work for many reasons which can be caused by a high work demands and people need to cope with their daily living. This development would have negative connotations, if people would not have a work-life balance and gradually affect their health.
Numerous workers have sometimes oblige to stay at work longer. Firstly, there are huge companies that need more workforce and time to keep up with work requirements. As an individual worker, sometimes requires to extend their work hours to finish the workload and assigned tasks. In most shipping companies or factories in the Philippines, for instance, there often have an outrageous number of workload to be done therefore multitude employees have been tied up to work and forced to render overtime. Secondly, nowadays people are facing in large of debts and bills. In Canada, the cost of living is quite high and unaffordable for some, so that several people work double jobs or often do overtime to earn extra more.
Spending too much hours working has two possible drawbacks, an absence or lack of work-life balance and acquiring diseases in the long run. For married people, family time is significantly valuable in order to maintain a good family bond. Workaholic people have the tendency to negelct the importance of family bonding and tend to experience health problems thereafter. According to one research in the US, found that the number of workaholic people was tripled from 10 million to about 30 million in over a decade and majority of these people suffered from stress- related diseases such as depression, heart disease and chronic back pain.

What are the difficulties while living in large cities then?Firstly, it is the lack of jobs and occupations due to the fierce competitiveness between thousands of applicants.Moreover,because of high number of employees,regularly will companies raise their standards making it painfully challenging to get a job .For instance,to be hired as an accountant,not only do you need flawless techinque skills but also flexibility and adaptiveness to satisfy the company's demand and surpass other applicants.Secondly,the increasing population density can be a potential security endangerment as the rate of criminals and lawbreakers is significantly higher than places with fewer residents.Furthermore,tracking down criminals will more challenging because of the widespread radius of populated areas.For example,chasing down a theif in a countryside would be far more easier than a city because there are less space to hide and shelter for the theifs.
Hence, the government should encourage people to move to outlying areas.At first glance,it fixes the issue of jobs and occupation as civilians are now fairly distributed to other regions, creating a less stressing and competitive working environment.As a matter of fact,the rate of poverty and famine will be reduced as the income for most famlies become higher thanks to more
job opportunities.In addition,by having scatterd citizen equally,we can ensure the safety of our people by managing the crime rate of each region.In fact,this will prevent crime concentration in one area but scatter them in many places,making it more convenient to protect civilians.

It contains the knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and even medicine and astronomy. Developed countries holding great power and resource probably have grand teams of science professionals. But in many countries, there are only few of students have chance to take science class and study the further professional subjects. Although this situation seems biased, but this is not a referring to that these countries are less developed. There are some possible reasons.
The basic concept of science knowledge is generally given in fundamental education of many countries. In my home country, Science is a basic subject that fixed in the fundamental education system. Students come to Science in a very young age. They gain knowledge not only from textbooks, but also from experiments, and natural activities outside the school. And this kind of forms of teaching can be seen in many countries' fundamental education. After entering the high school, not only science subject but also almost each subject are separated to more detailed subjects. Students are asked to choose a specific subject and study it, and expected to use it to be a career choice. And this is one of the potential causes of not having many students studying Science in some countries.
In developed countries, there are plenty of vacancies in different career types. For instance, we need medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, biological professionals, and even chemical and astrological professionals in the developed society to not only maintain our daily life but also to investigate and develop more advantage for the environment we are living.

people who live in previous centuries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
In this modern age, some believe that people's quality of life is much better than that of earlier generations in past centuries. I agree with this point of view thanks to the development of healthcare service and technology in this century regardless of some opposing opinions.
To begin with, some think of this school of thought in the sense that people living in the previous centuries were less prone to diseases caused by the degradation of the environment. For example, air pollution these days has caused people a multitude of fatal respiratory diseases, be it tuberculosis or even lung cancer. These illnesses were believed to happen to a handful of citizens in the past, such as long-term smokers or workers in mines. However, in this modern age, people appear to have remedies for aforementioned diseases or, at least, methods to mitigate them. As regards the former, scientists have been believed to invent medicines to cure these diseases while, for the latter, air purifiers have filtered toxic fumes in the atmosphere, reducing the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases.
The standard of living in the 21st century is in all probability better than our predecessors thanks to technological transmogrification. Firstly, the improvements of the Internet has allowed people to connect with others from all over the world via communication platforms, such as social networking sites or emails. This will help people be happy. Additionally, the advancement of technology is beneficial for information storage. For example, data is, now, can be limitlessly stored in the Internet with less concern of being damaged. This did not happen in the past, when information was believed to be saved on papers or hard disks, which were prone to damage due to extreme weather patterns.

In my opinion, I believe these statement can be both true and false at the same time.
Mixture of nationalities may promote country's development as some particular nationalities are more proficient in one particular activity than another nationalities. For example, Jamaican has a superior body in running. They are the whipping out all the gold medals in running. Each nationalities has it's own strongness, so they can help each other to develop the country.
On the other hand, development in the country may not be fast when different nationalities are in one country due to the conflicts between the locals and the foreigners about culture and language differences. Such conflicts may rise and result in slower development as there are going to be communication difficulties between the local citizens and foreigners. In addition, local citizens may be annoyed of foreign people taking away their jobs, creating more anger between each other. To exemplify, USA is one of the country that has multinational population. USA has developed a lot over a past decade and is a leader of technology but at the same time, it contains many social issues such as race hatred. USA is expected to develop less compared to other countries for many reasons, but mainly due to intelligent and competitive foreign experts leaving their country.
In conclusion, I believe different nationalities will play a critical role in the country's development. However, the government should educate their local people to understand and respect other country's cultures in order to maximise the productivity in their country.",7.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.
One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.
Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.
Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.
In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

What solution is better?,"Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.
Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.
In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.
Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.

From my perspective, although asking customers take this action is reasonable, I strongly hold that these service providers should play a more important role in this issue.
On the one hand, the reason why some people think customers should have more duties is that it ia driven by their demand. To be more specific, this is because they choose to buy some things with good packaging. But these goods are usually over packaged. Hence, if they reduce their demands for such products, producers and sellers naturally stop over package them to avoid a reduction in their busidness profits. For example, more and more people are persuaded to simply use a piece of paper to wrap the gift box instead of using a large number decorations.
On the other hand, they think it is driven by merchants as they have more control on it. Specifically, in order to sell goods better, they uauslly regard packaging as a tool to attract purchasers. In addition, if their competitors find it does help the sale of products, it also promote the competition on the packaging, which can further lead to excessive packaging. Take fast food for example, it is obviously that sometimes using just one bag can fit all food, but to gain a greater advantage over the competition, they may use a box or more to wrap them, and then, it creates a vicious cycle of over-packaging.

On the one hand, arranging a sport event is always hugely expensive. In democratic societies there is always a doubt if these expenditures are appropriate or not. Sometimes it could be thought-provoking about spending this money on charity, medical insurance or to reduce juvenile delinquency for example. Also, there are people who are not fans or spectators, for them this kind of expensive event is not interesting. For instance, in Russia it is a fact that the winter olympic games in 2014 had a lot of controversial ideas about whether it was really necessary or not.

On the other hand, when your country hosts an international sport event it is a nice chance to show how rich your country is and express solidarity in your society. It is a fact that events like this, for example ""eurovision"" or ""olympic games"" and other worldwide events help to create an interconnection between countries and cultures. During these events we can see what happens in other countries and how people there live.

However, this rapid migration has led to popluation explosion in cities which seems to put tremendous pressure on available resources. In order to restore normalcy, this movement ought to be reversed and this can be done in a number of ways.
To begin with, the most common reason why people move to urban centers from rural areas is the fact that urban areas provide a wide range of opportunities that enable people to live a better life. For instance, all major metropolitan areas in the world provide access to state-of-the-art facilties in healthcare and education. Needless to say, both these aspects are the piilars of a good quality life that every individual desires to live. Unfortunately, as rural areas generally lag far behind in both these aspects, people are forced to migrate to cities. Moreover, urban dwellers are undoubtedly benefitted by advancements in all avenues of inquiry compared to their rural counterparts. This is because of the speed with which urban areas are able to incorporate these advancments into their infrastructure. While it may take a couple of months for a technological innovation to make its way to a village, it is not uncommon to see resdidents of a city making use of that innovation within no time. Thus, it makes perfect sense for people to leave the countryside in order to settle in cities.
However, cities are suffering from a host of problems because of large number of people opting to settle here. Firstly, accomodating a burgeoning population is a grave challenge that grips cities. This can be circumvented by providing villages with the basic facilties essential to support life. This would deter people from migrating to cities. Besides, if attempts are made to integrate rural areas into the mainstream, they would be benefitted by latest technological developments and people would no longer feel the need to move to cities in order to take advantage of those advancements.

This as good as it is, aslo raised the cncern of tkaing care of elderly people. In my opinion, I believe that the ability to deal with this concern depends on two main factors, which are the degree of country developement as well as the society characteristics.
First of all, to be able to take care of elderly people, the relevant orginizations and innstitutions should be in place. However, this condition most of the time cannot be found in under-developed countires. That is because of the lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries, such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other european countires, are more capable of taking care of elderly. That is because they have the enough resources to fund such non-profitable orginizations.
Nevertheless, other factor that must be taken into account, is the society characteristcs. Here we mean, wheather the society is considered individualist or socialist. In social societies, countries do not need to allocate a lot of resources on elderly care, because this role is already taken by families. Where in individualist societies, most of the times elder people will be living alone. Therefore, when they reach the point where they cannot take care of themselves, they will go to elderly care houses.
To summarize, the ability to taking care of elderly people depends on two main factors, the country developement and the society type. If the country is developed or the society is considered social, taking care of the mental and physical health of elderly people will be eaiser. In contrast, if the country institutions are under-developed or the society is considered individualist, taking care of eldery people will be much harder.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Unfortunately, they create too much competition for some local businesses that have to close their doors. Some people believe their closure will bring the death of local communities. I totally agree with that statement because small businesses are at the centre of the local economy and bring communities together.
The main reason I support that idea is that local companies are crucial for the community's economy. Immense supermarkets are convenient because they sell a great variety of products, but most come from foreign countries. In contrast, local businesses often sell goods produced by the citizens of the community. Consequently, it stimulates the economy and creates jobs in the village. Numerous people rely on local stores to make a living, and their closure would force them to leave their town.
Another reason I believe local stores are fundamental for their village is that they bring people together. Supermarkets are very impersonal. They are mostly owned by gigantic companies, and their owners do not care about their employes. In comparison, local owners are part of the community and tend to know their staff very well and care for them since they probably live in the same village for a long time. It creates a sense of community that is essential for the survival of a village.

2,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, in western civilization, there is a debate on people who think to create an ideal society but why they are not able to achieve this. In this essay, I will give my point of view of an ideal society and after I will explain the methods to create this society.
To begin with, from my experience and perspective, I believe that the ideal society is a place without criminals and serious offenders. A community without crime is a wonderful and safe place for our children and our families to live in harmony without rapes, thefts and murders. For example, in an isolated village outside a theme park in Canada, the locals lived with rules and culture without violence and crimes and everybody was happy and satisfied with their jobs and social life. Furthermore, the local community was very well balanced without arguments and conflicts because of the lack of serious offenders and criminals.
On the other hand, the creation of an ideal society is something very difficult. I honestly believe that the only way to build a balanced community is to educate our children because they are the future of this world and they need good examples and knowledge to create a good character. For instance in Ancient Athens, Greece local politicians and philosophers were responsible to educate the young people not only in school but also in the street or open theatres. As a result of this action, young people received knowledge and fundamentals to be ideal citizens of ancients Athens.
To conclude, from my point of view there is no place for crimes and offences in an ideal society because these will destroy the balance and the harmony of the people. Furthermore, proper education is the best way to help our children to build good characters and balanced lifestyles.",7.0,6.5,"Scores: 7, 6"
2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The ability to associate at school has been a great concern. Owing to this, some assume that the optimal way to boost children's collaborative spirit is through school team sports. In my opinion, teaming up in school sports would be problematic, and therefore, should be implemented in certain occasions, with certain individuals.
Initially, participating in team sports would put a tremendous risk in injuries. Inevitably, physical group activities require high-speed movements, resulting in harsh collisions. Students then may lose their interest in those activities, or hesitate to attend in order to avoid any kind of damage to their body.
Another point to consider is that joining team sports can effortlessly breed serious competition among teammates. Therefore, at that time, the objective of cultivating cooperation would be replaced by the desire for accolades in children's mind. This consequently spells trouble for the hostile environment as the feeling of inadequacy and low sellf-esteem in students are growing.
Finally, the best solution would be offering team sports as an optional project for students. To illustrate, a school football match can open more opportunities for those into soccer and accept to play in unity. In this case, participants may have a chance to immerse themselves in a joint effort after being thoroughly disseminated about the rules. As a result, they are still able to enjoy the game while working in a joint project.
In conclusion, boosting children association by teamsports may not be feasible for all of them, but operating more joint projects for those with passion and fair play is a much better approach.",7.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued by some people that because nowadays people live longer than they used to, retirment age should be raised. In my opinion, I think that companies should use other measures to determine the right time for retirment.
In recent years, many companies have set rules for retirment age. This is because these companies believe that when people reach a certain age they do not performe as good as younger employees. As a result, many experianced employees lose their jobs, which can affect both employees and companies. For example, some companies require experianced employees to retire at the age of 60, which can lead to loss of valuable knowlege that can be used to train younger employees. To solve this problem, companies can use different measure to help them decide when to ask their emplpyees to retair or resign.
On the other hand, I believe that companies should focus on their employees performance and work quality, rather than their ages. The reason for this is that companies should retain well performing employees, which has nothing to do with age. For instance, companies can monitore their employees work quality as a way to meaure their ability to continue working. As a consequence, companies would have a stronger performance compared to other companies who use age as a measure, this is because they will have experianced and well performaing employees at the same time.
In conclusion, while companies uses ages to measure when it is the right time to retire, I believe that other measures such as performance and work quality should be used.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is important to experiance and learn certian kind of habits at younge age for children to develop them as they grow older. Growing vegetables and taking care of animals are two main practices children should develop at their younger age. In this essay I will discuss some disadvatages that would affect children during this process and explain why I feel that there are better advatages.
The most significant advatage of learning to grow vegetables is that children will initally start to understand the importance of eating healthy and also the process of growing vegetables. In this case children will learn not to waste food and how hard and the effort it takes to grow these vegetables. It is important that we keep reminding children from their primary age so that they will remember and practice as they grow older. Taking care of animals is another important thing that children should learn in their primary , this will teach children to care for others and not be frighten of animals. Furthermore, they will learn to respect animals and love them.
Some of the disadvantages of keeping animals is that some children has different types of allergies which will lead them to be more sick. However, some animals tend to be more dangerous than others. Another disadvatages is that when growing vegetables the compost and pestisides are dangerous to children or it might sometime be allergic to them as well. Insect bites during planting will also lead children to get sick.
In conclusion it is important to learn how to grow vegetables and take care of animals at their younger age since they develop certain habits and learn more indeapth which will be helpful as they grow older. Eventhough, some argue that it is more riskier for children I believe that the advatages outweight disadvatages.",5.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Doing activities, either in a group or alone, play a crucial factor in terms of self-development, leading to strong skills for people's life. Despite the fact that individual activities can improve a wide variety of people's competencies, I personally believe that people would gain more benefits from participating team activities than doing individually.
It is true that group activities potentially strengthen people's social skills. An argument in favour of this is that team activities require participants to collaborate with other team members. As a result, the participants will not only have to do their responsibility the best, but also helping others bring out their best potential. This is because a team cannot achieve its goal by any person, but by everyone working together. Another common example is that group activities also foster people's communication skills. In order to get what the team aim to succeed, each team members must deliver their messages via conversation in the simple and understandable way. Therefore, people doing group activities are likely to expose with this experience all time, helping them being capable of communicating effectively.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of doing activities as a team, it is the fact that doing individual activities also contributes to many essential skills. A classic example of this is the development in self-discipline. With respect to sports, people who doing sports alone such as running must strict with their running schedule in order to being able to run for their target distance. Another common criticism is the ability to not comparing themselves with others. When people doing activities alone, they will have to set their milestones to reach their target, meaning that they will truly understand their actual potential and not interfered by other people's progress.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that individual activities possibly help people have self-discipline and teach them to concentrate on their ability, not others. Nevertheless, after carefully contemplating the outcomes of both types of activities, I totally agree that group activities which result in better teamwork and communication skills are more important due to the fact that these competencies are the two most important factors for every people to be successful in life.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.
To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.
In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.
To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.",7.0,6.5,"Scores: 7, 6"

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.
Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.
I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.
In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

As a matter of fact, jobs are very important because is the only way that people have to earn money. However, in many countries, the distribution of salary is not equal and a small number of people earn higher salaries than others.
Some individuals think that this is good for the country because goverment encourage only categories that are more in touch with money, such as employees who work in banks, offices and who has a business. In other words, the economy of the country can increase in a significant way since goverments incentivate these categories by giving them extremely high salaries.

In fact, they are the ones who works for the wealth and the future of the society and it is unfair that they are discourage. Moreover, I also believe that these kind of jobs are more stressful and challenging than others and they work as good as categories that have higher salaries.

Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people's decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn't the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet.

I am of opinion that gay marriage should be legal and the reason will be outlined below.
To begin with, nowadays, human equality is becoming more and more important. Hence, men should have the right to marry a person with the same gender. Since this right is one of the fundamental living, governments should revise the law to reflect this type of marriage and enforce it accordingly. This is exemplified by developed countries, which pay attention to human rights, allowing a man to marry another man legally.
Furthermore, gay marriage will not be likely to cause negative effects on societies. On the other hand, this trend tends to increase countries' economic growth. As a result of implementing the policy which promote same-sex marriage, gay couple around the world tend to be attracted by this government support, and possibly move and live in the country. To illustrate this, there is research demonstrating that the economy of Canada has been growing substantially after allowing gay marriage to be legal.

However, not least have their opinion that students should spend more time on important subjects, particularly academic matters. I believe academic and non-academic subjects should be balanced, and this essay will explain both views.
Human brain development makes our kids learn many things in the early phase. Therefore, most elementary students have already learned math or non-native languages, which differs from the past 10 or 20 years ago. Also, they learn subjects unrelated to academics, for instance, science food and how to prepare it. These things are important to them, as they have the knowledge to choose healthy food and prepare it properly, cooked or uncooked. Another reason students should learn about this is that they currently love junk food the most for their daily meals, which is not a good fact for the next generation to have a long life.
Nevertheless, the knowledge of academic subjects should be learned in line with non-academic ones. The main reason is that it will be their foundation for a successful business or career. Without this knowledge, although they have an adequate understanding of the non-academic matter, they will find it hard to compete with other business competitors or candidates in any job recruitment. Eventually, with a long life and a good business or career, they will have a wealthy life ahead and, indeed, their life positively impacts others.

Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.
Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.

When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.

Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue.

Prima facie, education through internet has far more reach than any other method. Universities can approach students from all over the world, even a student from a remote area can be benefitted through the revolutionary internet courses. Online courses are also considered to be cost effective because a student can study from the comfort of home and save lot of living expenses.

An healthy and happy environment is significant and helps people learn more quickly.

Furthermore, they often state there is no value of learning history. Although some people's opinions are understandable to some extent, I strongly believe people continuously need to learn history to recognize modern social issues. I would like to state some reasons and examples to support my opinion.
Initially, people have a long history of how they improved their lifestyles drastically and violently from ancient times around the world. People kept fighting to increase their country's territory and caused innumerable victims. In addition, there were slaves who were occupied by invaders. As a result, they were often forced to move to another continent, such as America for the workforce and looked down on slaves. If people ignore learning this historical background, they will continue fighting and discriminating against them. Therefore, learning history will lead to how necessary to treat human rights equally.
Secondly, when it comes to the environment, there are several issues. Some disasters and global warming are triggered by human's sustainable long historical actions. After the Industrial Revolution that occurred in the 18th century, we consumed a lot of resources such as oil and coal, and the carbon dioxide emissions caused climate change such as global warming.
In addition, repeated deforestation led to floods and a sharp decline in native species. Unless people know the reason why such a revolution happened by history, people will take another action that is harmful to the global environment.
Finally, the causes of our modern society's problems as I mentioned above can be recognized by studying history. People need to take responsibility for a peaceful and eco-friendly society by considering a variety of views in history.",6.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren't the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society's perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters.

It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.

From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.
Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.
In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.
In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.",5.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

2,The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant.
It is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred.
In spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English.",8.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"

As a results any major city in the world is experiencing very dense traffic.This trend is now also being noticed in smaller cities too.
In order to reduce the amount of traffic, people should reduce their travel to work, education and shopping. At work that could mean working from home whenever it is possible, limitate the domestic and international business trip when not absolutely needed. Online studying could be generalized when the fied of study does not requires physical practice nor specific facilities. Since online shopping is becoming trendy we could change our habits and go on the web rather than in malls or in town in order to shop. The movement restrictions imposed during the covid-19, especially during the lockdown demonstrated that this is possible. However, during that period, most of us realized that this lack of mobility and travel freedom is not the best and is a heavy constraint, both personal and profesional.
Shouldn't we look for other alternatives in order to reduce the traffic ?
It is now well known buy all that using the public transportations is a great way to reduce the traffic. It is usually faster than using a private car and it is more eco-friendly. Even if it also has disadvantages such as the lack of timetable flexibilty, the lack of privacy, sometimes the price... it should be our prefered way of transportation whenever possible.
Carpooling is another great way to reduce traffic. Wether it is for daily trips to work or week-end escapades, that is a great way to contribute to a limitate the numbers of vehicules on the road. Maybie governments should find incitative measures such as the one on some U.S highways, where carpools have access to express lanes while the private drivers who are alone in their cars have more restrictions.
Even if our society is evoluting towards a very internet connected world where you can work, study and shop remotely, I think people might limitate their movement but won't stop travelling, whether it is long or short distance.

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Global warming is a serious global threat that no one can deny. The causes of making temperatures higher can be for various reason, but rencently there is a growing evidence that man-made activties are causing it. Man-made activites such as pollution can be one of the causes. Nowadays, we must focus on how we can deal with them and solbe the problem. This essay will include the causes and the solution on why our earth temperature is increasing.
At first, we are polluting the earth without realizing the threats or problems that this can cause in the future, that is because of the unawarness of our society. One of the main causes of the rising temperatures is factories. Factories production can cause severe air pollution, because of the burning waste or by blowing air that include chemicals out to the fresh air. The current rise of temperature is alarming. Deforestation is another reasons to this problem. Deforestation is caused by humans to sell it or use for our own benefit, but in reality we are killing planet earth.
To every problem there are solution. Since we are already in this problem; we better find a solution before it is too late. Even though there are man-made activites that are causing the problem, but there are some that can solve it. The introduction of electronic car is the beginning of the solution, where the use of diesel are decreased to make our vehicles more eco-friendly. As we can see today, restaurants and cafes are serving plastic straws; even though, this will not solve the problem immediately, but it is a good start to make our life more friendly to our environment.
In conclusion, global warming is a serious issue that must not be avoided. Although, we did put ourselves in this position, but we will also be able to fix it. The causes that drove us to this problem are used for a long time. However, reducing the amount of factory production or introducing eco-friendly machinery can be our way out.",6.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is believed that governments ought to pay full institutional fees for students who want to obtain higher education. I would say that I strongly agree with this statement.
To start with, the cost of course fees nowadays is much higher than it used to be a decade ago. One of the biggest problemss for school leavers is to manage to collect a huge amount of money that is needed in order to enter the university of your dream. Of course there are some scholarships that are very helpful. But the problem is that they are only available for very talented students who scored only high grades during their educational process, or for those who come from low-income families. As the result, students who have passion and necessary skills can not afford to study in the university.
On the ohter hand, paying for everyone's course fee would lead to a huge hole in every government's budget. The possibility of free studying for everyone sounds naive and kind of impossible. Another problem is that those students who are more likely not to participate well during their studies and might drop off the university after the first year will have an opportunity to enter universities. This will likely lead to problems with whole educational system. The only solution is to select wisely whether this or that student is ready to spend his or her time studying new knowledge and skills.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that the most effective way to teach children cooperation in teamwork is by encouraging them to join team sports at school. I completely agree with this idea and will give my reasons as follows.
Firstly, team sports require children to work together and practice communication in order to achieve a common goal. For example, in Taiwan, many schools have baseball lessons in sports courses, and some schools even have a school baseball team. In such courses, children can learn to trust one another and develop communication skills by playing. Furthermore, they can develop mutual understanding and compromise with their teammates in order to reach a common goal. In this way, they can develop their social skills, find a way to cooperate, and build positive relationships with their peers. As a result, team sports experiences will contribute to their social skills and social life as well.
Secondly, team sports can teach children the value of perseverance and resilience. Through the experience of competing with other teams, children can learn to accept the ups and downs of success and defeat and go through any difficult situations with their teammates. This is especially the case if they fail in a competition as they can learn to encourage each other and develop a sense of group belonging. For instance, we can see many touching stories in team competitions where despite being on the losing side at the beginning, the team rallies, and members encourage each other to restart. This can be a great lesson for children to build their resilience, self-confidence, and a sense of belonging, as well as develop a positive attitude toward their life in the future.
In conclusion, I believe that team sports provide children with opportunities to develop their social skills, increase their confidence and resilience, and ultimately benefit their whole life. Therefore, they should be included in the school curriculum for children.",9.0,8.0,"Scores: 8, 8"
2,The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.
English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.
In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.

Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don't pay them much.

The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work.

2,Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree),"In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn't justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can't buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company's budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers' and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay.

The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.
Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.
Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.
In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time.

In this essay, I will express my opinion with discussing both point of views.
One of the biggest advantage of humans compared to other creatures is its adaptibility. Humans faced serious natural disasters in the past and climate change was just one of them. With the adjustment skill that we have, we always found a way to stay alive and made it through until today. From this prespective, today's changes in climate change can be accepted and with a few adjustment in our life styles, it can be treated as another disaster in history that humans have been through.
However, if we do changes to learn live with climate change, it will cause us to drop our life quality in daily bases. For instance, air pollution will become a huge problem with the climate change and if we just adapt ourselves to live with it, we have to wear face masks everyday to reduce its harmful affect to our metabolism and this will limit our breathing. On the other hand, if we try to prevent climate change, we can keep the same way that we are living today. Furthermore, if we take serious actions to stop climate change, we have a chance to raise our life quality not just for today but also for the future. We can live in a world which has more green areas and this way, we can provide better environment to our childeren.

Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children's talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone's childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents' development.This is a well written essay.

However, it is a more persuasive argument that students studying a wide range of subjects throughout their school life is more applicable for their future.
On the one hand, studying a limited range of subjects from 15 years ago helps students to develop specific abilities. Once they decide on their stream of subjects such as art, science, or commerce, they will be focused on special training. This teaching method can help them to become a specialist or professionals.

Although rich countries give financial supports to the poorer, it seems the problem of poverty is far from find a solution. Some people suggest to opt for other kinds of help. I partly agree with them, and I argue that financial skills and intellectual support should be integrated to the economical help the countries sent to the Third World.
Financial support is surely essential in order to help the poorer country to sane their situations. However, money without managment abilities are not useful enough. Indeed, governement of the so called Thrid World, since they do not possess managerial and investment's skills have no chance to make productive the money they used to receive. They can spend the money to solve the immediate issues they have to deal with without caring of the future perspective. For instance, nowadays countries used to send economical help to African countries. How do the poorer spend the money they receive? They built hospitals, schools and buy medicines and the primary necessity products they need. They cannot do more. This involve that as soon as the money and the resources they bought through them are finished, they cannot even mantain open hospitals and schools. They are again in poverty.
What then do the poorer country need? Economical support is not enough. They need also professional people who have to teach them the managerial skill they need. For the development of their countries, it is essential to understand how to invest the money and how to make more money starting from the support poorer used to receive. They cannot do this by themselves, rather they need to be guided through the contemporary economical attituted that the richer countries have been developing over the years. The idea just presented is confirmed by the fact that the countries of the Third World are used to be defined the richer at least from the natural resources they have. Nonetheless, they cannot be able to exploit the natural capital they posses because of their lack of skills. Tanzania, for instance, is a place full of interesting products. However, they have not specialised people able to interact with the richer country in order to start a business. To send money without teaching them how they can use them, it is the same as to give to a child a bycicle without teaching him how riding. Once, a child has learned the technique behind the riding, he will never be worth knowing how to do it.
In conclusion, I believe that countries should integrate the ""how to do"".

Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.
Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.
In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.",8.0,6.5,"Scores: 6, 7"
2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Nowadays, it seems that the goal of every nation should mainly focus on economic purposes such as increasing production of materials and goods. However, I personally believe there are more important things than the economy, which governments should pay more attention to. For example, health systems, education, fundamental rights etc. Despite this, in my opinion, production should be also a main goal but it is also crucial for the well-being of the country, to make a balance among all objectives.
On the one hand, countries rely on the economy in order to make money, provide people with jobs and make a way of living. So I believe production of material and goods is essential in every economy. Nevertheless, constant increasing of production is not very healthy for the country, as it may end in a surplus of goods and materials. Moreover, the situation could get worse if companies would not know what to do with all the excess products.
On the other hand, taking care of inhabitants of a certain country is as important as producing. Without health, education and values, most nations would not survive. I also believe that you cannot have a strong economy without a healthy population, as people are the ones that work in production. In other words, both aims complement each other perfectly.
As a conclusion, I would like to highlight the fact that constantly increasing production does not benefit anyone, it also may harm people. And governments should be more aware of other complex issues like the ones mentioned above.",6.5,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
2,Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.
I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.
In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.
Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.
What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.",9.0,8.0,"Scores: 8, 8"
2,"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","This is true that some people are sure that civil servants should avoid harmful sport activites, but other part of sosiety thinks that individuals should have freedom to choice any sport that they like. I am in two minds on this, but probably governments should take care of their citizens and be responsible for human lives.
Firstly, extrem sports are very popular above young generation in all over the world and these kinds of activity are the huge part of pastime for thousands people. Risk's lovers spend planty of time and enormous amount of money to feel freadom and to try themselfs as a brave and strong persons. For instance, in my country such sports as rock jumping, mountain cyicling and BMX are very popular. And even if these activites are dangerous, young men and women are keen on it, and they are against the governments who wants to ban this sports.
On the other hand, adult people always want to protect younger ones. To my point of thinking protection is significant habbit of human beings that we need to respect. However, governments, who try to ban dangerous sports, need to be more flexible, and not only say no for harmful sports, but involve young generation in activites that are not so risky. I also belive that media attention can make seance about all cons of extrem choice, becouse information about number of death between exrem sportmens can be helpful.
Summing up, the buning dangerous sports topic is rather complecation and importaint issue. I suppose that, the sosiety need recive more information about harmful sports, while governments have to be more responsible in building anouth common sport facilities.",5.0,5.0,"Scores: 5, 5"
2,"Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is argued by many people that history contains the lessons to help us understand human's life while others believe that we can hardly learn anything from the past. It is my opinion that history is a precious source of information that we inherent from the older generations and history is important for our future. This essay will discuss both views and give reasons to support my points.
Some people think that the history is not important for us to grow and develop in our current life. I personally think that this is not true because our development in society today is the outcomes of learning from our mistakes in history. In addition, the history of our country or our region will help to enhance knowledge about our culture, beliefs or religions. These values are generational heritages and it is impossible for the new generation to obtain the cultural values without learning about history.
It is widely agreed that history is a valuable source of knowledge that enables human development and prosperity. The records of events and experiences of the older generations will be helpful for us in building our society for future generations. For example, in order to build the current social welfare system in America, the government has to look at the failures of other countries in the history and considers which approaches will be appropriate for their people. In addition, learning about history can broaden our understandings about human philosophy, human interations and conflicts. These knowledge are significantly important for our development intellectually and spiritually.
In summary, we can learn a lot from history and history is important for human development.",7.0,6.0,"Scores: 6, 6"
